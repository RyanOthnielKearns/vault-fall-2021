# Reading Reaction for Saul, [[Saul Dogwhistles.pdf|"Dogwhistles, Political Manipulation, and Philosophy of Language"]]
## PHIL 181

"And yet, I will be arguing, these new discussions have not yet moved far enough  
away from the focus on content. Fully making sense of politically manipulative  
speech will require a detailed engagement with certain forms of speech that  
function in a less conscious mannerâ€”with something other than semantically  
expressed or pragmatically conveyed content; and with effects of utterances that  
are their very point and that nonetheless vanish as soon as they are made  
explicit. None of the machinery developed in detail so far is equipped for this  
task" (2).

I know this paragraph comes in the preamble of the paper, but I cannot help feeling that the claim Saul is making is quite strong, especially the last sentence. I would be curious to hear a Gricean attempt to subsume dogwhistles under their theory of conversational implicature. It seems to me that you could theorize of dogwhistles as special cases of conversational implicature where the implication is particular to certain features of the audience. This doesn't sound all to alien to Grice, I think, because we're already accustomed to language users employing normal English to various degrees of nuance.
