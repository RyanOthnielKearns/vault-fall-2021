# Part I: From Embodiment to Cognitive Extension
## 1. The Active Body
- Some interesting talk about how robots that rely on the morphology of their own bodies to support or facilitate movement end up expending significantly less energy per unit weight moved
- J.J. Gibson's "ecological psychology" (1979)
> biology capitalizes on the regularities of the entire system as a means of ordering behavior. Specifically, the structure and physics of the environment, the biomechanics of the body, perceptual information about the state of the agent-environment system, and the demands of the task all serve to constrain the behavioral outcome. (William Warren 2006, 358)
- Introduces a principle for embodied / extended cognition called **Principle of Ecological Assembly (PEA)**: a cognizer, on the spot, recruits whatever range of available problem-solving resources that will serve to solve the task with the minimum effort required
- Contrasting a classical view of perception, where the intention is to capture enough about the external world to build a standalone internal model where the cognizer then takes actions, largely independent of the world that perceptive capacities first referenced. Instead, "they use the sensor as an open conduit allowing environmental magnitudes to exert a constant influence on behavior" (16)
- On multi-modal input, that we take in with a temporal lock-step: "the presence of an active, self-controlled, sensing body allows an agent to create or elicit appropriate inputs, generating good data... by actively conjuring flows of *multimodal*, *correlated*, *time-locked* simulation" (21) (emphasis mine)
- See Van Gelder and Port (1995, 14) on **total state**, responding to dynamical systems exhibiting what Clark calls **continuous reciprocal causation (CRC)**, where activity in two systems continually causally affect one another
