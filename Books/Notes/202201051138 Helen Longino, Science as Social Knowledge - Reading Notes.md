# Preface
- originally the "negative intention" of critiquing a "value-free science" $\rightarrow$ now the more positive thesis of "developing an analysis of the scientific knowledge that reconciles the objectivity of science with its social and cultural construction" (ix)
# Chapter 1: Introduction: Good Science, Bad Science
## Motivations
- motivating question: *how do we judge the claims of science?*
	- more specifically: "How should these demonstrations and allegations of the interaction of *science* and *social values* affect our conception of *scientific knowledge*?" (3, emphasis mine)
	- Longino's aim: show how social values play a role in scientific research via scientific reasoning

## Goal of Scientific Activity
- goal of scientific activity: production of *explanations* of the natural world
	- what makes a good scientific explanation = what makes good science
	- these values (constituting good scientific methodology / practice) called **constitutive values**
- contrast with **contextual values**: personal, social, cultural values held among science practitioners
- asserting "value-free" science is asserting that constitutive and contextual values are orthogonal
	- scientific freedom from contextual values takes two forms:
		- **autonomy** of scientific inquiry: inquiry proceeds undisturbed by values / intersts from the sociocultural context
		- **integrity** of scientific inquiry: the core practices of science (observation and experiment, theory construction, and inference) are independent of the sociocultural context
			- more core & less extreme than asserting autonomy

- *is a value-laden science necessarily "bad"?*

## 3 sketches for the scientific knowledge <> contextual values interaction
1. Robert Richardson (1984): contextual values influence reasoning in only bad ways
	- Theses should be judged on account of evidence / falsifiability, not ideological incompatibility
	- Good scientific inquiry works to weed out subjective preferences in theory selection
2. Social constuctionist approach: scientific theories are products of their historical / cultural context
	- weak and strong views attacking, correspondingly, the autonomy and integrity of scientific inquiry
	- also a viewpoint in feminist thought
	- influenced widely by Kuhn's *Structure of Scientific Revolutions*
3. A mix of the two: we can achieve methodologically correct science by weeding out the "bad" scientific influences like racism and sexism
	- Donna Haraway argues against: can't suppose that any methodology would be "correct" while also suggessting that observation in science is theory-/paradigm-determined; it invites paradox

## Feminism and Marxism in Longino's approach
1. There are standards of rational acceptability that are value-independent. BUT
2. Satisfying these standards in a theory won't guarantee that the theory is value- or interest-free

- the feminist / Marxist claim: pointing out the "pervasiveness of interdependence in human societies" (12)
	- Longino's similar tack: arguing that knowledge is developed socially and not individually
		- is this similar to Hardwig (1991)? Book was published the year prior...

# Chapter 2: Methodology, Goals, and Practices
- the *paradox of inquiry* from Plato's *Meno* ( #Plato )
	- $\rightarrow$ beginning of the "traditional task of the logic and methodology of the sciences" (16) -- how do we justify that our scientific theories count as knowledge? and what type of knowledge?
	- Marjorie Grene (in *The Knower and the Known*): the paradox of inquiry solved by understanding inquiry as a human activity and science as a *practice*
		- a **practice** (MacIntyre in *After Virtue*): "any coherent and complex form of socially established cooperative human activity through which goods internal to that form of activity are realized in the course of trying to achieve those standards of excellence which are appropriate to, and partly definitive of, that form of activity"
			- those "standards of excellence" *nonarbitrary* and *nonsubjective* w/in the practice
- Longino won't be committal regarding the proper internal goods of scientific inquiry
	- multiple valid conceptions of internal goods, held by multiple stakeholders (PIs, technicians, mathematicians, etc.)
	- knowledge is not the private domain of any of the stakeholding individuals
	- no philosophical consensus as to what comprises a good scientific theory (see next section...)

## Philosophical Accounts on Scientific Method
- acknowledge distinction between *descriptive* and *prescriptive* functions
	- "how do we" vs. "how should we"
	- in AI: consider a model of the way humans tend to solve a certain task (called *simulation mode*, with descriptive considerations) vs. the best way to solve that task (called *performance mode*, with prescriptive considerations)
- central debate historically looks to be the logical positivists / empiricists vs. everyone else
	- #logical-positivism #empiricism 
	- centered on the "nature of theory reduction" (21)

### Logical Positivism
- "radical empiricist epistemology applied to science" (22)
	- epistemology is *prescriptive* here ("what counts as knowledge?")
- the **cumulative model** of scientific inquiry: successive theories in a field progressively account for wider ranges of phenomena (and are consistent w/ earlier theories)

#### Confirmation
- logical positivists on evidential relations
	- e.g. Hempel (in "Studies in the Logic of Confirmation"): when is a hypothesis corroborated by a given body of evidence?
		- Hempel's search is for a formal syntactic criteria, like the formalisms present in mathematical logic, but for confirmation
		- Hempel's **direct confirmation**:
		> An observation report $B$ directly confirms $H$ if $B$ entails the development of $H$ for the class of objects mentioned in $B$.

		- Hempel's **confirmation**:
		> An observation report $B$ confirms a hypothesis $H$ if $H$ is entailed by a class of sentences each of which is directly confirmed by $B$.

		- We only need to see if certain entailment relations hold to see if confirmation holds
	- Unfortunately this doesn't work: places constraints on legitimate scientific theories positing abstract and non-observable entities like electrons
		- Cannot have the same predicates occuring in the hypothesis as occurred in the observational sentences

### Wholism
- motivating puzzle: in the history of science, inconsistent theories have been equally adequately supported by available relevant data
	- e.g. Ptolemaic vs. Copernican cosmologies
	- this is a strike against the positivists' cumulative model (of scientific growth)
- critique of positivism centered around the characterization of what serves as evidence
	- rejected the idea of theory-independent observation
	- instead, science progresses by the "adoption and abandonment of large-scale frameworks ('paradigms')" (26)
- *the only theory of these three to leave room for social-value-laden scientific inquiry* (according to Longino)

#### Theory-Ladenness
- applied to meanings: says the meaning of terms in a theory are determined by the theory
- applied to observations: says one's observations and experiences are colored by or pass through the lens of the dominant theory

#### Incommensurability
- a consequence of theory-ladenness
- opposing theories that account for identical phenomena cannot be compared with either other (or the facts) for one to be considered *true* or even more correct
	- instead, theories adopted and abandoned like religious faith

#### Problems with Wholism
- models intended to replace positivist ones don't get us very far
- theories can be mutually incommensurable and mutually inconsistent
	- we don't have a vocabulary for talking about the two theories together
- in Kuhn: if theories are accepted via gestalt switches in the scientific community, evidential considerations are at best useless or else self-deceptive

### Scientific Realism
- **realism**: the claim that theories in "mature" sciences are *approximately true*, and progressing theories approach truth more closely than their predecessors
	- "approximately true" means the theoretical claims of the science are meant to be taken *literally*
	- and we can *know* that they are true
- one tangible benefit: provides the best (or only) explanation for the predictive success of current scientific theories
	- Richard Boyd: if scientific methodology is instrumentally / observationally reliable, the best explanation for *why* is *theoretical reliability*
	- at the same time, just because a hypothesis / theory is the best explanation for a set of data doesn't mean the hypothesis is true

#### Issues
- scientific methodologies are not infallible -- lots of failures in the history of science

## The goals of scientific inquiry
1. the goal is the "construction of comprehensive accounts of the natural world" (32)
	- both Hempel and Kuhn, despite their differing viewpoints
2. the goal is the "discovery of truth about the natural world" (33)
	- e.g., Karl Popper or Feyerabend

- the dichotomy shouldn't be seen as an ambiguity in need of resolution -- rather, "reflective of a tension within science itself between its knowledge-extending mission and its critical mission" (34)
	- both knowledge-extension and truth (points 1 and 2) can be fundamental (but not necessarily compatible) goals for proper scientific inquiry & methodology

### Kuhn's "Permanent Values in Science"
1. accuracy
2. scope
3. fruitfulness
4. consistency
5. simplicity

### Goals moving forward
- show how social / cultural values play a role in scientific inquiry
	- broadening scope from individual to social / cultural construction helps us see that science is not "hopelessly subjective" (37)
