___
- we think of current as a flow of positive charges (*not* the way electrons move on the wire...)

# Agenda
Today:
- review major concepts from past lecture and modules

# Learning Goals
## Current Learning Goals
- What makes something an electrical circuit?
	- (intersting) properties depend on the flow of electrical charge through the circuit
- **Charge**: just a property of matter
	- Flow of charge = **current**
	- Moving charged particles can transfer energy
- Current is *continuous*: current that flows into something must flow out

## Voltage Learning Goals
- **Voltage**: electrical potential energy difference of charge (between two points on a circuit)
- Sum of the voltages across any devices in a loop is **zero**

## Power Learning Goals
- electrical devices can supply or absorb power
- positive current is current flowing into the $+$ terminal (for consistent results)

## Electrical Devices Learning Goals
1. Voltage source
	- takes whatever current is needed to maintain voltage
2. Resistor
	- current / voltage are proportional ([[202201051030 ENGR 40M Module 7 - Electrical Devices- Voltage Source, Current Source, Resistor#Resistor Model|Ohm's Law]])
3. Current source
	- takes whatever voltage is needed to maintain current
