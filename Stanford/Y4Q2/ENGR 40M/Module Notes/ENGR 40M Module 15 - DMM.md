# Learning Objectives
- use DMM to measure voltage and current
- never try to measure the short current of a voltage source!

# Probes
- red probe: $V\Omega mA$
- black probe: COM (common)
- separate lead for anything $>10A$

# Voltmeter
- goes in *parallel* to the device you're trying to measure the voltage across
- ideal voltage meter should take no current to not affect the circuit (*impedence* should be as low as possible)
	- act like an open circuit

# Ammeter
- goes in *series* to measure the current along that series
- current direction through Ammeter need to match reference direction of the circuit itself
- ideally should act like a short circuit and drop no voltage
	- typically not ideal: drops tenths of volts when measuring typically

- a `1 .   ` measurement tells you that the value is too big to be resolved -- switch to higher scale
- with measuring low currents, the lowest current scale will sometimes offer up some resistance that gives an incorrect measurement -- check the higher (lower resolution) scales and compare the values
