# Learning Objectives
- inductors affect how currents change
	- model devices storing magnetic energy
	- voltage is related to how current changes
		- kind of the opposite to capacitors
- transformers / motors are types of inductors

# Inductors
- two terminal device
	- linear device: doubling $V$ will double $i$
	- stores energy like a capacitor
defining equation:
$$V = L\frac{di}{dt}$$
- $L$ is *inductance* (measured in Henrys)

with sinewave current:
$$i = i_o\sin(2\pi ft)\Longrightarrow V = i_o2\pi fL\cos(2\pi ft)$$
## Impedance of an inductor
$$Z = \frac{V}{i} = \frac{2\pi fLi_o\cos(2\pi ft)}{i_o\sin(2\pi ft)} = j2\pi fL$$
- means:
	- low impedance at low frequencies (inverse of a capacitor)

## Function of an inductor
- affects how fast a current can change
	- fast current changes require lots of voltage
	- inductors try to keep current changes slow
- for very small $\Delta t$ inductors look like current sources
	- can supply very large voltages if needed for the current
	- contrast w/ capacitors, which look like voltage sources for small $\Delta t$
- for very long $\Delta t$ inductors look like shorts
	- contrast w/ capacitors, which disappear given long $\Delta t$ (open circuits)

## Ideal Inductors
- have no loss, can store energy by letting the stored current "circulate"
- real inductors, by contrast:
	- unless superconducting, have significant resistance from the wire
	- can be modeled by an ideal inductor in series with a resistor
		- resistance causes a voltage across ideal inductor, meaning current *decreases*

## E&M for inductors
- models energy stored in magnetic fields
	- current through the wire causes a magnetic field
- most inductors we use have magnetic *cores* (the schematic symbol for them is different -- has 2 parallel lines next to it)
- changing magnetic flux induces a voltage
$$V = \frac{d\phi}{dt}$$
where $\phi$ is magnetic flux (Faraday's law)

## Transformers
- energy is stored in magnetic field
	- field is generated by the current
- two coils of wire around the same magnetic material
	- can transfer power between the two coils (via their shared magnetic field)
$$\phi = iL;\ V = \frac{d\phi}{dt} = L\frac{di}{dt}$$
## Motors / Generators
- really just a kind of inductor
- wire wound around magnetic thing
- with fixed magnets on the outside, as the motor moves it moves through a magnetic field
	- $\phi$ changes proportional to speed, which generates a voltage
