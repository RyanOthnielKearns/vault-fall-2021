___
- electrical devices can supply or absorb electrical power
	- Power = current $*$ voltage

# Electrical Energy
- **[[202201041817 ENGR 40M Module 4 - Voltage#Electrical Voltage|Voltage]]**: electrical potential energy
	- Volt = Joule / Coulomb
		- Moving 1 Coulomb of charge up 1V requires 1J

- **Power** in an electrical component: $(i)*(v) = 1A * 1V = 1\text{ Joule/sec} = 1$ Watt of energy
	- Power is *energy transfer*: Watts = Joules / sec

# Energy and Power
$P = i\cdot V$
- since energy is conserved, device (e.g. a battery) does *something* will this power
	- resistor turns it into heat
	- LED turns into light + heat
	- etc.
- Your brain uses around 30W of energy

## Energy Flow
- if positive current flows *out* of the *higher* voltage terminal...
	- carriers have gained energy, meaning device supplied the energy
- if positive current flows *in* to the higher voltage terminal...
	- flow out of lower voltage terminal --> carriers lose energy --> device absorbed energy

### Labeling Convention
- current reference direction should match voltage reference ($+\rightarrow -$)
	- positive current = current flowing into positive-labeled terminal
	- calculating in this way will give power *absorbed* -- so if device has negative power, it is *supplying* power
- going from $+$ to $-$ -- voltage supplied is "minus" (see [[202201041817 ENGR 40M Module 4 - Voltage#Kirchhoff's Voltage Law KVL]])
