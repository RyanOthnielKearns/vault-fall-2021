- System International Units: units for electrical measurements

# Terms
- **Voltage** (volts)
	- driving energy for electrical circuits
- **Current** (amps)
	- measure of the flow of electrical charge
- **Power** (watts)

# International System of Units
- all measurements w/in the International System of Units (metric or MKS)
- standard **prefixes**!
	- important b/c electrical systems have extremely wide dynamic range
	- e.g. amps in terms of $\mu A$ or $nA$ (micro and nano)
		- $\frac{1}{1000}A = mA$
		- $\frac{1}{1,000,000}A = \mu A$
		- remember factors of 1000
