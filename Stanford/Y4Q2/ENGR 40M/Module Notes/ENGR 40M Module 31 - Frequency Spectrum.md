___
- tonal representation of sound

# Learning Objectives
- signals can be represented in different ways
	- time varying voltage
	- or as a set of tones added together
- using tonal representation is useful for many tasks
	- analyzing tone depends on electrical components

# Playing Audio Rapidly
- can't simply play audio faster, since this changes the tone
- idea: shrink the time, but preserve the tones
	- shorten the time of each tone

# Representing Signals in Different Ways
- can represent sound as a string of numbers
	- representing voltage at different times
- also think of sound as combinations of tones
	- summations of different sine waves (forming *overtones*)
	- spectographs
- all sound can be represented in these two ways

# Transforms
- finding the "right" representation
- often we work with the transform of our data rather than the original data (as we did in the demo w/ frequency shifting / speeding up audio)
