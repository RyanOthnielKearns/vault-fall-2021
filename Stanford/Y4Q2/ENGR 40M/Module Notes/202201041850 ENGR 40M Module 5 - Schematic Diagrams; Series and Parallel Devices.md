# Schematic Diagrams
- standard way to draw diagram of circuit
- boxes represent an electrical **device**
- lines represent **connections** between devices
	- (idealized) wires (have no voltage drop)
	- current flows through wires
	- wires crossing in a $\top$ shape are considered connected
	- if crossing in an $\times$, need a dot in the middle to show connection
- each type of device has its own symbol
	- circles are voltage sources (have constant potential difference across their terminals)

## Terminology
**Node**: all the points on connected black lines (that touch each other)
- charge on a node has exactly the same potential energy
- voltage across any two points on the same node is always zero

## Non-uniqueness
Many ways to draw the same circuit that look different on paper

# Parallel Devices
Two devices in parallel if voltage across two devices is the same
- the top terminal of the first device connects to top terminal of the second,
- likewise with bottom terminal

# Series Devices
Two devices are in series if the same currrent is running through them
- if they can be drawn s.t. the only connections to the middle node are the bottom terminal of the first device, and top terminal of the second device
	- e.g. a single node only connecting the two devices and nothing else
