___
- 3 kinds of electrical devices with different properties / schematic labels
	- each type has different relationship between voltage and current

# Voltage Source Model
- voltage across device is constant
	- equal to voltage of the source
- current will be whatever the circuit needs to maintain voltage
- battery is *almost* a voltage source
	- voltage across it is constant
	- but not ideal... small dependence on current

# Resistor Model
- current proportional to voltage
	- Ohm's Law: $V_d = i_d * R$
		- $Ohms = \frac{Volts}{Amps}$
- model a battery instead as a voltage source in series with a small resistor
	- a little bit of resistance causes a little voltage drop across the resistor, which is compatible w/ actual batteries

# Current Source Model
- current through the device is constant
	- set at the specified value, can support any voltage

# Models in General
- *models* for real electrical devices
	- good for approximation of the actual device (for predicting behavior)
	- most engineering: creating and using models to predict the future
