# Current
*current is continuous*
- must flow always in a loop
- whenever it flows into an object it must flow out of that same object (current in = current out)
	- current flow in a wire remains the same along it
	- wires & devices are thus charge-*neutral* (net charge is 0)

- in electrical systems current is carried by **electrical charge**
	- if charge flows, that makes the system electrical
	- charge can flow only in **conductors** (materials that carry charge)
		- copper is one of the best conductors
		- **insulators** do not allow charge to flow through them
- charge measured in **Coulombs**
	- each electron has charge $-1.6\times 10^{-19}$ Coulombs
- opposite charges attract, like charges repel
	- like charges repelling is what causes charge to flow
- **current** = flow of charge per second
	- past a certain measuring point
	- Ampere (amp) = Coulomb / sec
	- symbol for current is $i$
	- usually drawn with an arrow to indicate direction

## KCL
Constraints on Currents
- currents along parallel wires (devices) sum to the total current flowing through the circuit

*Kirchhoff's Current Law* (KCL): current flowing out of any node must equal the current flowing in
- all components are charge neutral
- sum of currents in = sum of currents out

## Labeling / Measuring Current
- sign is just relative to the reference direction
	- if current is positive, then flow of charge is *actually* moving that way
	- if current is negative, flow of charge is moving in opposite direction
