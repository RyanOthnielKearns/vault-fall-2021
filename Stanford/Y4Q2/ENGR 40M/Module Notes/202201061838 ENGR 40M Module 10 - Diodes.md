# Diode
- new electrical device! with unusual current / voltage relationship
	- either a voltage source or an open circuit
	- only positive current can flow
		- meaning as much voltage across it as you want in the negative direction -- no current will flow
		- *only* able to operate in Q1 -- can only absorb energy, cannot provide it
			- modeled by a vertical line across Q1
			- $V_d < V_f\rightarrow i_d = 0$
			- $i_d > 0\rightarrow V_d = V_f$
	- plus end called the anode, minus end called the cathode
- examples
	- LEDs
	- solar cells
		- light generates a current producing electrical power
			- captured energy from the light
		- value of the power is proportional to light intensity
- fixed voltage ranges from 0.3V to over 3V
	- if voltage $< V_f$, diode looks like an open circuit (0 mA current source, like it doesn't exist)
- $i-V$ graphs still work!
