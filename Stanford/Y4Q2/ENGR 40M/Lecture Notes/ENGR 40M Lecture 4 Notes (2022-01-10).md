___
- because solar cells have i-V points in Q4, *they can provide power to the circuit*
- once you have nodal voltages, can do nodal analysis $\rightarrow$ solve for the unknown voltages / currents in any circuit
	1. Choose one node to make your reference (ideally a node with a lot of connected elements)
	2. Label nodes w/ unknown voltages
	3. For those labeled nodes, write the current equations
	4. Relate the current to voltages (e.g. using $i_R = V_R/R$ or [[202201041758 ENGR 40M Module 3 - Charge and Current#KCL|KCL]])
	5. Solve for voltages

- Strategy for setting reference directions: look at the circuit and try to guess which directions are going to be positive (e.g., resistor next to a battery should have $+$ terminal facing the $+$ terminal of the battery)
- Positive current only flows into the $+$ terminal
