# Learning Objectives
- one can use MOS transistors to do logical operations
- be able to tell whethera MOS circuit is a good logical circuit
	1. make sure circuit always contains Vdd and Gnd
	2. make sure Vdd and Gnd aren't connected directly
- be able to analyze the logical function of a MOS circuit
- be able to create logical functions using transistors
- understand *binary numbers* as a type of code
	- represent negative integers in the coding
		- use two-complement notation
		- *only* differences between negative ints and ints in computer programs are during prints and comparisons
___
- pMOS transistors must have sources connected to Vdd
- nMOS transistors must have sources connected to Gnd (see [[ENGR 40M Module 22 - MOS Transistors#MOSFETs MOS Transistors]])
