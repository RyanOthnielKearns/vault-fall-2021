# Today
- binary numbers practice
	- relevant for counter in the Arduino: the counter overflows! need to code it s.t. things don't break
- logistics for midterm:
	- bring 1 sheet of paper
	- Friday 4pm
	- Hewlett 200
- hardware debugging practice
- light
	- why light is different colors
	- why different color LEDs have different $V_F$s, due to different energies of the photons being emitted
- time multiplexing
	- transmitting many bits on a single wire by transmitting sequentially in time
	- "trick the eye" by turning on small groups of lights at a time
	- common method requires CMOS transistors, but we can do a similar technique with LEDs
