Transistor resistance $*$ gate $+$ wire capacitance sets CMOS gate delay

Last thing for this class: **impedence**
- set of *linear differential equations*
- look at the response of the circuit to *each tone* (instead of an arbitrary waveform, look at combinations of sine waves)
	- for sinewave input, capacitor looks like a resistor
		- resistance depends on the frequency of the tone
		- effective resistance is called impedence
