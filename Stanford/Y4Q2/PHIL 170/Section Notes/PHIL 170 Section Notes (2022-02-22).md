___
Hume's **passions**: inclinations that aren't thought of as "good" -- they're simply felt / desired / what have you
- nothing more to be said than just "that's what I want"
- not subject to rational examination
- Kant: if you involve yourself in any way in terms of means-end reasoning, you're already on the Kantian side w.r.t. your reasoning in some sense
	- Kant's reasoning takes you to *one place* -- one of the biggest advantages / potentially biggest flaws in his theory
- Hume's theory of mind: the **"bucket" model**: mind as the place where mental events happen -- nothing above this constituting "mind"
# Radio Man
- Quinn wants Radio Man to rationalize his action by there being something good about it -- feels kind of maximalist or even "Kantian" in its demands

Nagel's "parsley on the moon": some desires are unmotivated in a rational way, sort of whimsical? How do we rationalize these?
- to regard something as good / valuable in some way -- means it has an attractiveness you can expect *people to share*
	- e.g. wanting parsley on the moon *because its beautiful* appeals to a value people can dissent or agree on
	- Bernard Williams: to call an action *good* is to paint it in a way that appeals to other people's judgements of the good
