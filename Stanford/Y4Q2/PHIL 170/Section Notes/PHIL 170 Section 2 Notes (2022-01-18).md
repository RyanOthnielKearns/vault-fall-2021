___
- for Nagel in "War and Massacre"
	- the soldier bayoneting another one: "it's either you or me"
		- is it about reciprocation, then? couldn't you justify any evils using this "either you or me" logic
	- *being a human being* as a necessary condition for *being a soldier*
	- the *interpersonal justification*:
		- people (soldiers) taking actions to putting themselves in harm's way? the idea about *choice* in choosing to enter combat (what about draftees???)
		- what matters is the relation you have to the other person (e.g., being enemy combatants) -- and *not* necessarily how you entered into that relation
			- human beings "as soldiers" are justified in their use of deadly force against each other
			- "conduct your violence on the shared expectation of hostility"
- "investigating the morality of baseball?" --> just consult the conventions that are laid out explicitly in the rules of baseball -- no room for deep moral philosophy if the rules of the practice are explicitly codified
	- Nagel appeals somewhat to conventions, e.g. in justifying that punching someone in the mouth is appropriate *at the level of insults* because in our culture it's considered an insult
- the non-conventional, deeper, more principled explanation for this relational view: to do with the most direct interpersonal relationship with the person you're dealing with?

- does it matter who started it?
	- separately the laws of going to war, and the laws of conduct once at war
		- e.g. for going to war, it's only justifiable to go for reasons of defense, etc.
		- whereas once at war, it's not justifiable to use chemical weapons, etc.
