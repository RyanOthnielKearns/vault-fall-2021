# Discussion: Williams on Consequentialism
- story from the gospel of Matthew: Pontius Pilate giving the order to put Jesus to death
	- instead of saying "this is my job, Jesus you're being put to death" -- crowdsources the decision by asking the crowd whether Jesus should be put to death
	- Pilate appealing to the notion of "intervening moral responsibility" that Williams is arguing about
		- Williams: utilitarian is asking you to *really revise* your moral committments
		- utilitarian perspective is already a part of our moral toolkit: you *do* have negative responsibility
- characterization of utilitarianism as emotionless: thinking about numbers and not people -- that's disturbing by itself!
	- Williams: it's obvious to the utilitarian what the answer would be -- the point is to highlight the place of moral intuitions
- what role should moral emotions have, according to Williams?
	- look at the optimal utilitarian: how have they sculpted their mind to make these decisions in the way they're supposed to?
		- Williams: that person is starting to look like a real weirdo
		- but: there are ample resources to resist this, if you're Smart
			- jumping into a lake to rescue Adolf Hitler: Smart talking about praise and blame
				- p. 347 in [[J.J.C. Smart 1950, "Extreme and Restricted Utilitarianism".pdf|"Extreme and Restricted Utilitarianism"]]
				- you're still praiseworthy even if you've acted in a way that increases suffering (by saving Hitler)
				- Williams: it's kind of convenient that you can always come up with a utilitarian reason to not do something horrific...
- promises in utilitarian cases (e.g., Jorah taking Dave to the airport)
