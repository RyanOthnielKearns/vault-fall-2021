today: [[Herman, Barbara 1981, “On the Value of Acting from the Motive of Duty” (annotated).pdf]] and [[Anscombe, G.E.M. 1958, "Modern Moral Philosophy".pdf]]

- **moral worth** - we read about it in the groundwork... is it really a *thing*?
	- in layperson parlance: "moral compass" seems to describe moral motivations / generalized tendencies instead of applied to individual actions
- what to do when Kantian duties conflict? (they're supposed to never conflict....)
	- moral duty comes from this logical construction -- follow rules that never contradict
- "Moral Saints" -- there's a moral answer to what to do and also plenty of other accounts as to what's the *right* thing to do
