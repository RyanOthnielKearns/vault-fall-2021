# Argument reconstruction
- a philosophical **argument** says: "You are here. And I'd like to convince you to be *here*"
- premises $\to$ conclusion: the argument is the "$\to$"

1. Identify premises and conclusion
2. What follows from what?
3. And how?

- the ideal to be "approached" in your argument construction: fully formal modus ponens, etc. like Aristotle's *Prior Analytics*
- goal: show the argument valid *while* explicating some of its internal structure
	- 2 ideals:
		1. Formality
		2. Perspicacity
