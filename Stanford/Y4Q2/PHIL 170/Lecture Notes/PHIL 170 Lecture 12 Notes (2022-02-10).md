# Intro: Kant, cont.
- scientific image of the world: things occur in accordance to causal laws or rules
	- to Kant: there are these "special" objects in the world (*us*) who act in accordance to the laws they *represent* to themselves and then purport to follow
	- how to articulate this view? sounds crazy...
	- Schapiro 107: "Kant maintains that freedom is in all three of its aspect -- as *law*, *capacity*, and *world* -- is not to be thought of as something cognizable according to theoretical reason"

## Rawls: Action as Participation
- Schapiro uses Rawls' point about practices to illustrate something deep in the structure of Kant's position
- Rawls on practices: the rules *define* the actions they regulate, and claim a certain *authority* over those actions by doing so
	- e.g. "stealing a base" -- can't make sense of this out of the "stage setting" of baseball
- a person does something that has as its end something given to us by the rules of the practice
	- e.g. the end of "scoring runs" within the context of baseball (*meaningless* outside the context)
	- Schapiro: there's another sense -- also taking as our end *participation itself* (my end is to participate in the practice)

## Schapiro: A Practice of Freedom
- is this exegetical claim, *as one*, actually a proper way of interpreting Kant's practical philosophy?
	- even if not, might provide help in understanding how to think *as a Kantian* (separate to interpretations of Kant)
- *interpret Kant's account of practical reason as a **practice of freedom***
	- to be committed to using one's reason in order to act, one has to be *committed to participating in the practice of freedom*
	- "In acting upon that law, we see ourselves simultaneously as living up to an ideal conception of the world with which we identify, and as doing what we can to make that ideal descriptive of the world within which we must act" (108)
	- practices specify (through their rules) new kinds of activity
- Schapiro: way to read Kant is to understand this ur-practice, the practice of freedom, where the form of activity specified is **action itself** (109)
	- "rational" action itself
	- by playing "nature's game", opting out of the practice of freedom by "put(ting) yourself in the role of a mediate cause in a nexus of mediate causes"
		- acting on the basis of "autonomous principles is to take up the role of a first cause"
			- subjecting yourself to this rule (and other practice rules) grants you the "power of freedom" (Schapiro calls this **authorial power**)
			- authorial in the sense that you sign your name, admit ownership (and therefore responsibility)
			- also an exercise of causality in a way
			- as participants, have "the power to impose on their movements the status of moves"
	- Kant identifies rational agency with the "power to make things count" (111)
		- instances of rational agency / wieldings of authorial power happen *by way of* heeding authority to the rules
- The rules of the practice (of freedom) are the **standards of good reasoning**
	- to Kant, these are the **hypothetical imperative** (which tells us to take the means to our own ends) and the **categorical imperative** (the moral law for Kant)
- by heeding authority to those rules you make your movements count as rational action
- yet none of this is a matter of *theoretical cognition* of yourself or others as a being who is (*really*) free

# Herman: Moral Motivation and the Motive of Duty
- Kant: only actions dont from duty have "moral worth"
	- so should you desire to despise your friends in an effort to make helping them more morally worthy???
	- e.g., the "presence of an inclination" to perform an action will prevent that action from being done from duty
