# Preamble
- Reading: [[Herman, Barbara 1981, “On the Value of Acting from the Motive of Duty” (annotated).pdf]]
- Also discussing [[Korsgaard, Christine M. 1988, "Two Arguments Against Lying".pdf]] (from [[PHIL 170 Lecture 9 Notes - Korsgaard's Two Arguments Against Lying (2022-02-03)|last time]]) and [[Schapiro, Tamar 2001, "Three Conceptions of Action in Moral Theory".pdf]]
	- re-covering a bit of the territory from last time's conversation

# Kantian Ethics from last time
- ethical theory must teach us to *use* (and then justify) certain concepts
	- concepts central to ethical theory, on Kant's understanding, are not like *natural* concepts like "zebra"
	- in using "zebra" I'm aiming at *describing / representing the world accurately*
		- zebras are "cognizable by theoretical reason"
		- think about a different concept like "legitimacy" -- how do I *apply* this concept? In the same way?
		- rather than aiming at *representing the world accuracy*, I'm instead aiming at *how to act correctly* via my application of the concept
		- the role of the concept ("legitimacy") is to provide me with grounds for action -- *practical* in a way that "zebra" is not (directly, anyway)
	- **practical concepts**: not about accurately depicting the world / describing truths, but instead about *acting correctly* -- used in reasoning about what to do
		- a power or a faculty -- one that we ascribe to mature, sane, human adults
		- we're not in the interest of accurately depicting the world via our power of practical reason
			- doesn't mean we can't err in our use of this power! there *is* a **standard of correctness**, albeit one that differs from the one when we incorrectly apply "zebra" to a horse

# Practical reasoning
- like all reasoning, about **following rules**
	- we're **rational** when we following rules of good reasoning
	- rules govern or have authority over the individual engaged in the reasoning
		- think of these as various cans and musts that have *inescapable force*
		- you *cannot* avoid willing $M$ if you accept that $E$ is an end of yours and $M$ is a necessary means to $E$
			- not willing to cause $M$ is *self-defeating* so long as I continue to accept $E$ as an end
		- Harry Frankfurt's thinking on why rules have inescapable force: "like behavior that frustrates its own ambition, contradictory thinking is irrational because it betrays itself"
- Kant defends the **hypothetical imperative** (thinking about rules *as if they are addressed to us*): "take the means to your ends! figure out what's required of them and then *do it*"
	- thus, ***immorality** is a matter of **contradiction***
		- the "force" of moral rules is the inescapable force of the rules of good (moral) reasoning
		- we can't escape these rules but we can *violate* them
			- we can make a mistake (e.g. affirming the consequent)
			- but, tricky to say whether anyone can "choose to disobey" a rule of reason -- I *can choose to disobey* a valid order (from a superior at work, e.g.)
			- when it comes to acting immorally, we should be comitted to the idea that we are *free to choose* our actions using our reason -- not determined at all by outside forces
- Kant: the thinker in moral philosophy who takes *most seriously* the kind of ordinary presuppositions we have about moral life
	- What is presupposed in my ascribing to someone the ability to think morally correctly?
	- Kant: it's going to be surprising how much we need to revise our conceptions of the world to "get it right" -- morality is the more fundamental part of our relating to the world

Plan for next time: more into the nitty gritty details of [[Herman, Barbara 1981, “On the Value of Acting from the Motive of Duty” (annotated).pdf]] and [[Schapiro, Tamar 2001, "Three Conceptions of Action in Moral Theory".pdf]]
