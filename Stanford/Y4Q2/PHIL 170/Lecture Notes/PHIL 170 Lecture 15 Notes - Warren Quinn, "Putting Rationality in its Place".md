# Two Anscombean Ideas
following from [[PHIL 170 Lecture 13 Notes - G.E.M. Anscombe, "Modern Moral Philosophy" (2022-02-15)|last week's lecture]]
1. The "mesmeric" force of the distinctively *moral* "ought"
2. The need for a **philosophy of psychology**
	- in the ascription of desires, wants, intentions etc.

-> following in [[Foot, Philippa 1972, "Morality as a System of Hypothetical Imperatives".pdf|Foot's paper]] and [[Quinn, Warren 1993, “Putting rationality in its place” (annotated).pdf|Quinn's paper]]:
1. To Foot: the "fugitive" thought in Kant's categorical imperative (we don't need this in ethical life -- can in fact get along better w/o it)
2. Quinn: rationality as *thought about the good*; desire as *minimally evaluative* (we can't have desires in a purely descriptive way if we're thinking about agents' reasons for action)
	- on what it is for human beings to be moved in ways that count as rational
	- meant to indict a popular alternative, namely the subjectivist conception of noncognitive yet "rationalizing" attitudes
	- rationality is the excellent kind of thought about the (human) good

# Quinn
## Two Questions
1. Is Quinn's argument against the *neo-Humean* model of rationality + motivation an argument *against* Foot's suggestion of morality as a system of **hypothetical imperatives**?
	- might read Quinn as saying: the mere system of hypothetical imperatives, wherein people have (good moral) ends and take reasoned (instrumental) means toward those ends, doesn't account for the force of moral motivation
	- maybe a closer reading of Foot's text should caution us from putting these two philosophers directly in conflict
		- Foot: we can "evaluate ends" at least in some sense
2. All three thinkers ([[Anscombe, G.E.M. 1958, "Modern Moral Philosophy".pdf|Anscombe]], Foot, Quinn) express a doubt that *morality* ought to be special
	- e.g. the emphatic moral ought, or moral reasons / principles as *uniquely categorical / unavoidable*, or as the *sole / ultimate goal* of action
	- do we want a **sharp boundary for morality**? e.g. a hard way of distinguishing what is moral from what is not
		- answer is "obviously yes" if we're Kantians
		- think about the analagous case with the law -- should violations of the law have a "fuzzy territory" in the middle? That seems bad...

## "Rationalizing" Action
Key question: *do "pro-attitudes", conceived as mere functional states, give an agent reasons for the actions to which they give rise?*
- **rationalizing**: making sense of an action *qua action* = giving an account of it (reasons supported from the agent's perspective)
- "making sense" < acting *well* or for *good* reasons
	- yet it's more than a causally adequate account of a person's behavior

### Pro-Attitudes
Quinn's examples:
- Donald Davidson's person who wants to drink paint
	- the desire to drink the paint is just *that* -- only a desire. Nothing good about it grounding that...
- Anscombe's wanting to touch a spot on the wall
- ... there's a way of describing these actions, where if we ask the agent "what's good / appealing / desireable about that?" the answer is "nothing, I just want it"
	- a popularly "Humean" answer that handles this: if we can attribute some basic "desire" for an end to the agent, *actions constituting the pursuit of that end* will be *rationalized*
		- so, someone who desires to drink paint is *unusual* but not *irrational*
- Quinn will argue contra the Humean answer
	- attitudes are *mere* functional states -- need to ascribe something more to them for them to count as rationalizing -- something like positive *evaluation* of the end as good

### Hume
- influential idea: the ends that people have (their reasons for action) are not under the authority of reason (*Treatise on Human Nature*)

#### Neo-Humeanism
- questions about rationalizing action just come to questions of *efficiency* in pursuing the ends we take without reason
- human motivation starts w/ something not subject to *rational criticism* (Hume calls these *passions*)
	- you just either have them or you don't
- using one's *practical reason* effectively is thus something purely (merely) *instrumental*. How do I satisfy the goals / desires I have? I cannot judge whether my goals / desires are in any sense *correct*

### Quinn's "Radio Man"
- this man has a pro-attitude in the "merely functional" sense -- does not see anything particularly good about turning on radios
	- is this even a coherent description of a psychology? the fact that it feels unusual may be a point in favor of Quinn's idea...
- if the Humean theory of motivation was correct, Radio Man's pro-attitude toward radio turning-on should be sufficient to *rationalize* his turning on radios
	- Quinn: intuitively this is not sufficient. The mere presence of a motivational impulse, no matter how effective as a matter of psychological fact, cannot *render actions rational*
	- Quinn wants Radio Man to see something good about turning on radios
		- this can include motivations to stop the unpleasant feeling that occurs when the radio is off -- this motivation is *cognitive*, contra Humeans -- it has *subject matter*
		- he must *see something attractive* -- not enough to just *be attracted* -- in / to the action (some evaluation, some subject matter)
