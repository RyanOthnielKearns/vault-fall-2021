# Philosophical Writing
- [[Pryor, Jim, "Guidelines on Writing a Philosophy Paper".pdf]] resource on this is one of the best to reread (with [[Pryor, Jim "Guidelines on Writing a Philosophy Paper" (annotated).pdf|annotations]] too)
- Writing -> Organization -> Exposition -> Argument
	- Writing, then organization the most foundational -- if you're poorly organized, it will be difficult to properly engage w/ other philosophers' work and make your interpretation of them clear

## Writing
- mechanics of writing
- disciplinary-specific conventions of the genre

### Grammar, punctuation, and spelling
- point of a phil paper is to give an argument that's *logically* precise
	- doesn't mean that grammar and prose can be abandoned
- **small words** -- default!
	- *ideas* should be big and abstract and unwieldy
	- similarly, use **short, simple sentences**
		- one professor uses the 17-word rule for single sentences
- don't use the thesaurus! as in [[Pryor, Jim "Guidelines on Writing a Philosophy Paper" (annotated).pdf]] if you change the word you're using you might be subtly changing the meaning, causing audience confusion
	- it pays to be "openly self-reflective about a writing style" -- if two words mean the same thing you should just go out and say that
- use of first-person pronoun "I"
	- doesn't mean back away from the claims you're making! treat your own voice as one of philosophical authority

### Simplicity and Dignity
overarching point about philosophical writing: simplicity / dignity in style & tone
- multiple ways to do this

## Organization
### Introductory Paragraphs
modeled off of *abstracts* in the sciences
- should state a **thesis**
- convey what is interesting
- start in the "right" place
	- no "since the dawn of time"
	- also no direct quotation, immediate source, etc etc. make it appropriate!

### Conclusion
- paper shouldn't just "stop" -- need some final or punctuating thought
- some obvious mistakes to avoid
	- don't *overstate* the point of the paper
	- consistent in style w/ philosophy paper of simplicity + dignity -- make clear that the point you've made is important, but acknowledge that there is still work to do

### Paragraph Organization
- not just a pile of sentences; it is a *unit*
	- unity is given by serving some singular purpose
		- explain a single idea
		- support a single claim
		- lay out an argument on behalf of another philosopher
- should have a **topic sentence**
	- if you cut down to the thesis and then all of your topic sentences, and then concluding sentence, you should get something resembling your abstract
- and then other sentences that help by *clarifying*, *amplifying*, *explaining*, *supporting*, etc.
	- ask yourself, "what purpose does *this* sentence serve in accomplishing the purpose of this paragraph?"
		- you must have an answer, otherwise fix or cut

### Structural Words & Expressions
- liberal but *correct* use of:
	- words making explicit the relation between ideas (because, since, given, thus, therefore, hence, nevertheless, however, but)
	- **signposts** to indicate to your reader what you're doing ("I will begin by"; "I will now defend the claim that"; "Further support of this claim comes from..."; "For example, ...")
	- words that amplify / emphasize / highlight what's important: (clearly; evidently; in other words; the crucial point is that)
- make the structure of your paper transparent!
	- be **systematic**
		- think about the way you shop for groceries -- going into the store w/ no plan, vs. going in with a system / a list

### Outlines
- the prompt is *not* a proposed outline for the paper about it
	- part of what's being assessed in the way you took the prompt and decided to organize it

## Exposition
- e.g. of another philosopher(s)
- good philosophical exposition != writing a book report!
	- not a reporter -- think about lawyering, teaching, advocating, etc.

### Charity
- no glory in defeating a dumb argument!
- you'll most likely be arguing against an argument you've reconstructed
	- do so in the most credible / forceful / formidable way you can
	- "*even in its best rendering* this argument does not work, because..."

### Accuracy
- not allowed to cheat!

### Lazy, Stupid, and Mean Audiences
- write for a "cold" audience -- pretending this will make your writing better
- *particularly* when it comes to the exposition part

### Quotations
- use *very* sparingly or not at all
- seems like (for these PHIL 170 prompts) you can write an effective response with no quotation at all
- maybe 2 permissible uses:
	1. if you're ascribing a view to a philosopher that may come off as *surprising* to a knowledgable reader
	2. stylistic usage: if a philosopher has made a claim in such a powerful, forceful way that the most forceful way you could convey the point is to quote them, then you have to do it

## Argument
- the whole point of the paper
- make up your mind by asking yourself *what **you** think*
	- and make it *philosophical*
- make it relevant
	- to the prompt that they've asked
	- and to the ultimate point of the article & issues it puts on the table
- avoid *"counter-assertion"*
	- you may find that some assumption a philosopher makes that you disagree with (e.g. if you disagree with $P$ in the context $P\to Q$)
		- can't go along the lines of "I think $P$ is wrong, and it wasn't argued for, so I can assert $\neg P$ and then avoid all the consequences of $Q$"
- make sure what you give *is an argument* ("here's what *I* think and why you should think it too")
	- careful not to lapse into a philosophical narrative or autobiographical style

# Kant's *Groundwork*
"Deontology: Evaluation of Actions *Themselves* Rather Than Their Consequences"
- some actions are simply "wrong in themselves"
	- these are simply fundamental, and any account of morality that doesn't capture the "absolutely must"s and "absolutely cannot"s is incomplete -- because these thoughts are familiar
	- this is the part of Kant's moral philosophy that's "above the water" -- aims to describe an element of morality *that we all see*
		- difficult about his philosophy: ultimately, what he thinks is that the majority is under the surface
- in order for what's above the surface to be correct, we are committing ourselves to a complex & rich system of deeper philosophical ideas that need to be unpacked
	- they're quite striking and quite *different* from the way we commonly think about our moral selves
	- **practical reason**
	- **freedom**
	- **autonomy**
	- **responsibility**
	- all of these terms (maybe not practical reason...) have common English usages
	- we *have to be able to make sense of* / be entitled or even *required* to employ in our thinking of what to do, in order for morality to make any sense
		- Kant: we can apply these things to ourselves -- but the sense in which we do so is *quite different* from what we might be tempted to do
