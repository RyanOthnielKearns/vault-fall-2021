# "Anti-Moralism"
**Morality** *prescribes a way of life* -- a way of making choices, approaching relationships, organizing / interpreting one's feelings, motives, etc.
- is that way of life *the best way of life*? Is being a "morally good" person all that good?
- Thrasymachus & Callicles (Socratic dialogues): being "just" is just a matter of following conventional norms, which are purposed to benefit others (it's being a "dupe" or a "tool" for more powerful people)
	- no ultimate justification for moral principles once you really unpack them -- you've just been duped or brainwashed or something
- Nietzsche: the moral life = life deprived of richness, meaning, sources of real value more broadly constued (namely splendor, beauty, power, etc.)
	- Nietzschean skepticism: morality is a "sickly condition for human beings"
	- moral philosophers have traditionally "toed the line" -- there are lots of things to make a human life valuable, but you can't have other aspects *before* you decide to live a moral life (e.g., constrained by certain principles that provide a "background structure" to how other goods can fit themselves in)
- ... better not turn out to be just a dispute about how we use "morality"
	- not likely this is going to be the case
- agreeing with this common psychological observation -- understanding yourself to be under a sense of obligation, struggling to do things that are difficult but understanding they are required of you anyway
	- prima facie acknowledgement of moral force
	- anti-moralists: the better we understand what's going on, the more we want to reject that moral authority governing our lives
		- instead, what do we want to look at for living a meaningful, rich human life? might want to call that "morality" too if you want, but it's not the same as Kantianism by any stretch (going to look completely different)
		- but we agree about the "first-order moral phenomenology" -- disagreeing on whether it's vindicated by philosophical arguments, or instead discredited

## Virtue and Anti-Moralism
- putting the more virtue-theoretic thinkers (Anscombe etc.) in concert with Williams

### Common Themes
1. atheism (or at least a complicated posture toward religion)
	- social/historical/psychological role of religion in bringing about morality as a social phenomenon
	- this is going on in [[Anscombe, G.E.M. 1958, "Modern Moral Philosophy".pdf]]
		- morality as would only make sense as *divine command* -- but we've removed the divine commander
	- also Nietzsche... self-explanatory
2. a skeptical / cynical posture towards (most) moral philosophy
	- Anscombe really only vindicates Aristotle as a moral philosopher...
3. a tendency towards *anti-system*
	- suspicious of attempts to *systematize* -- out of a recognition that this often involves *falsification* to some degree
		- [[McDowell, John 1979, "Virtue and Reason".pdf|McDowell]] about "non-codifiability of ethics"
4. a more "realistic" view of psychology / motivation theory

### Potential Points of Divergence
1. Morality: how much a philosophers' invention?
	- how much are the "bad guy" philosophers actually responding to something actually present in society, rather than some philosophical theory?
	- Anscombe differs from Williams here: Anscombe: the thing modern moral philosophers are trying to theorize about here *actually isn't a thing at all*
		- we should do a different philosophical project: more like a philosophy of psychology
		- "the world is not sick" to Anscombe
		- in stark contrast to what Williams is doing: where the mistakes of philosophers are just *symptomatic* of the mistakes of humanity (ethical mistake of human beings putting themselves under a moral authority)
2. Reason, & the role of emotions / drives / other psychological elements
	- anti-moralists offer a different conception of human reason (from the one one finds in Kant)
		- [[McDowell, John 1979, "Virtue and Reason".pdf]]'s main focus, also [[Quinn, Warren 1993, “Putting rationality in its place” (annotated).pdf]]
		- reason is the key to understanding human beings / human motivation... philosophers just have the wrong picture of it
	- anti-moralists: too much weight put on the capacity of human reason and not enough on the other qualities that make humans good
		- virtue theorists like Anscombe are "rationalists" in a certain sense of the term -- humans are special in capacity of their reason
		- Williams / Nietzsche / Foot are skeptical of putting reason at the center like this
3. The "human good" vs. existentialist influences
	- thinking about what humans *are like* can ground a conception of what the good is, "written into our nature" as a consequence of the types of things we are
	- a more *existentialist* influence: not committed to a source of meaning in human life external to one's own actions or projects (not religion or our nature or something else)
		- animating the anti-moralists to a degree: skeptical that we can get meaning "out of" morality
4. Optimisim vs. Pessimism; risk; vulnerability
	- virtue theorists express a kind of optimism -- "not-optimism" from Nietzsche, Williams, [[Wolf, Susan 1982, "Moral Saints".pdf|Wolf]]
	- there's *vulnerability* in subjecting the things that matter about a human life to outside forces (authorities) who might distort them or mess them up
	- default assumption in moral thought: *strict impartiality*
		- think of [[Taurek, John M. 1977, "Should the Numbers Count?".pdf]]: we're *on the hook* for an argument about why we'd prefer to save our friend than a stranger

# Three Related Ideas
1. **Attachments / Projects / Committments**: in order to be invested in living her life, a person must have *committments* that are *distinctively her own*
	- requires more sustained and honest appreciation of what it takes to form an attachment / form and pursue a project, etc. -> in order to derive the sense of purpose / meaning in one's life so that one's life is to go "well" -> this is **incompatible** with an authority above and beyond your control (morality, requiring subordinating all committments to impartial considerations)
2. **Character and Well-Roundedness**: morality recommends *one-dimensional* ideals. Life would be *boring and uninteresting* if all people only cared about this
	- we like people who are witty, irreverent, sardonic, etc. -> people who spend time on hobbies / pursuits that they couldn't hope to justify in a world of scarce resources ([[Wolf, Susan 1982, "Moral Saints".pdf]] will comment on this -- that's as it should be! We should be grateful that morality is at best a kind of authority figure that we often reject)
3. **Meaning, Motivation, and Luck**: success / failure in most important projects is up to *luck* (also, vulnerable to failure)
	- but *moral success* is supposed to be immune to luck
		- this "promises a kind of control over our own lives & how well they go"
		- as a psychological fact, this is simply not credible -- we should be suspicious of assigning moral value such a preeminent place in our lives

# Williams on "One Thought too Many"
- *notorious argument* at the end of Williams' [[Williams, Bernard 1976, "Persons, Character, and Morality".pdf|paper]] that's become associated with his philosophical work at large
	- have in mind big picture of the landscape / skeptical critique of the "normal science of moral philosophy"
- what justification is there for being *partial* to particular others?
	- always appropriate to *ask*
	- to Williams: "she's my wife" ought to satisfy any reasonable request for moral justification
	- why suppose this? why should moral justification even get a foothold here in the first place?
	- the connections to people w/ deep interpersonal relationships run "deeper" than any purported justification
		- it would literally *make no sense* to ask someone what justifies priviliging attachment over impartial consideration
		- thinking "she's my wife, and I'm permitted to prefer saving my wife in this circumstance" is *one thought too many*
