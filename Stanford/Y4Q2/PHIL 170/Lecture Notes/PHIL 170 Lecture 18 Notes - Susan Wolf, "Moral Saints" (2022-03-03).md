Reading for today: [[Wolf, Susan 1982, "Moral Saints".pdf]] (with [[Wolf, Susan 1982, “Moral Saints” (annotated).pdf|annotations]])

# Open Discussions
- can a demeaning, disrespectful, or otherwise offensive jokes be *funny*?
	- relationship between our sense of humor and our capacity for moral evaluation... what should this be?
- should artists consider the consequences of their art in moral terms?
	- is the novelist responsible for *anticipating* the consequences? letting this affect their writing process?
- related: separating the art from the artist, when the artist themselves has done monstrous acts
	- Roman Polanski, Woody Allen, Bill Cosby, Floyd Mayweather

# Related Ideas in Williams and Wolf
1. **Attachments / Projects / Commitments**: committments distinctly your own make life livable & meaningful
2. **Character and Well-Roundedness**: in particular, the one-dimensionality of a life lived only in the pursuit of morality

# Wolf on Moral Saints
- **moral saint**: a person who shapes her life according to morality's absolute authority
	- a person who is as morally good as can be
- Wolf: moral saints (if there are any) are really quite unattractive people
	- they lead lives few of us would admire
	- moral saints let morality *dominate* their lives, at the expense of other non-morally valuable things (a sense of humor, artistic talent, athletic prowess)
	- that threat of domination != a failure of well-roundedness
		- instead: about how moral value relates to other kinds of value. moral saints *seem to be doing what morality requires*
		- recognizing the other sorts of goods that are (in part) requisite for a complete and well-lived life are going to come into conflict with this person's absolute moral conviction
			- hard to make absolute morality into a goal in the same way as, say, becoming an olympic swimmer

## Four Kinds of Conflict
1. Simple *crowding out*: if you're too busy being perfectly good, you don't have time to be interesting
2. "Logical" interference: certain admirable traits require characteristics that are *antithetical* to morality (e.g. good insult comedy and the requisite acerbic wit)
3. Resource tradeoffs: some expenditures of resources are impossible to justify -- always morally better options for their use (think Peter Singer, e.g. eating / cooking fine cuisine when people are starving)
4. *Meaning*: the potential for conflict between moral and non-moral activities is always there
	- we want certain things (like "unconditional love") outside the jurisdiction of morality

## Wolf's "Point of View of Individual Perfection"
- Aristotelean types (Anscombe, other virtue theorists) etc. take their skepticism about modern moral thought as an opportunity to look backward for inspiration
	- Wolf doesn't do this
- Wolf introduces the idea of *metamoral reasons*
	- morality retains a *"claim"* to authority, but we have meta-moral reasons for denying that claim -- we're allowed to incorporate other values at stake in a more encompassing POV
	- don't be persuaded, like the Kantian, by a view of moral law that's all-encompassing and irreconcilible with other values
	- **intuitionism**: at the end of the day all you have are semi-messy intuitions about things that you're going to have to reconcile
		- not going to get something more systematic than these intuitions
- can we make sense of this? what does this imply for moral philosophy?
