**Contractualism** names a philosophical strategy for articulating and defending principles that embody a certain ideal of social relations
- living *together* on terms we can all regard as *fair*
- named from the role of **contract**: principles advanced as if as the result of an unforced agreement among parties subject to them

continuing from [[PHIL 170 Lecture 6 Notes - Contractualism (2022-01-20)|last time]] with Rawls & others

# Scanlon's Contractualism
1. To *what* do the principles apply? What do they regulate?
	- all actions! individual *conduct* itself (much more ambitious than Rawls)
	- to specify moral *right* and *wrong*
2. How should we envision the contracting parties?
	- parties are informed, reasonable, seeking a system of rules to govern individual conduct -- the *basis for justification to one another* (despite diverse aims / interests)
	- everyone has a veto, though they must use it in a reasonable way
	- compare w/ Rawls' "veil of ignorance" -- *not* employed in [[Rawls, John 1958, "Justice as Fairness".pdf]], where the view is actually closer to Scanlon's
		- even in early Rawls' idea, abstracting away from *some people's interest* -- cannot just exploit arbitrary advantage, have to act in good faith
		- idealization also in Scanlon's version: people will show up and stick up for their own interests, e.g. some arrangement is not permitted if it hinges on some particularly self-sacrificing people willing to take the brunt of it -- the fact that they could dissent *in principle* should be reason to reject
		- aim (for Scanlon) is to be "less thin and more substantive" than Rawls (per Jorah)
	- as we'll see later with Mills: what's the purpose of this abstracting away from concrete details? (Mills has a skeptical answer)
3. What principles are chosen?
	- the "familiar" principles of moral right and wrong
	- any allowed by a "system of rules for the general regulation of behavior which no one could reasonably reject as the basis for informed, unforced, general agreement" ([[Scanlon, T. M. 1982, "Contractualism and Utilitarianism".pdf]], p. 110)
		- to Scanlon: permissible = not wrong, required or "right" = all other acts would be wrong
		- Scanlon's **funamental principle of morality** (alongside e.g. the "greatest happiness" principle, Kant's categorical imperative, etc.)
		- the kind of thinking in [[Taurek, John M. 1977, "Should the Numbers Count?".pdf]] was influential to Scanlon
			- to Scanlon: not thinking of others as patient / recipient of one's actions, but rather "party to" them
			- but similarity w.r.t. the shared rejection of the idea of "summing across persons" as a calculus for decision-making
			- is Scanlon looking for more concrete answers in complex cases like the [[PHIL 170 Lecture 3 Notes (2022-01-11)#Negative Responsibility|Pedro example]]?
				- has different things to say than Taurek w.r.t. the "role of impartiality"
				- partiality on the *input* side of people considering principles & rejecting them -- how much partiality is reasonable?
			- Taurek: the conditions for *agreement* are poor -- e.g. people won't very often be making decisions with their best moral intentions
				- there are default rules that apply in the absense of agreement
		- the key question: *what exactly is it I do when I'm deciding between $X$ and $Y$?*
			- best reply to that kind of challenge: "I don't see my job as a moral philosopher as 'making the hard cases easy' -- the hard cases are still hard! What I'm giving you is a *framework* for discussing and considering those cases, to be more clearheaded in your defense of an answer to a question like that"
				- according to #JCC-Smart: every moral question has a discriminate answer to it, though there may be epistemic issues with accessing the correct answers to moral questions
		- deeply modern, classically liberal idea to form some contractual agreement about the moral life, rather than reverting back to something like the wars of religion, etc.
			- to Scanlon: is there *any* purpose beyond that of reaching agreement?

## Key differences between Rawls and Scanlon
#John-Rawls #TM-Scanlon
#TODO: ==should turn these people-of-interest tags into pages==
- Rawls on institutions as primary focus, vs. Scanlon on the governing of individual conduct
	- Morals vs. Politics?
	- Scanlon's thought is broader: picture of all interpersonal commerce that can get off the ground by way of this imaginary contract
- Self-interested *rational choice* under (partial) ignorance (Rawls) vs. non-rejectable given free, informed, *reasonable agreement*
	- Rational vs. reasonable? The difference?
		- **Rational**, understood as "correctly taking the means to your own ends" -- whether or not your ends are morally correct or not
		- The "reasonable person standard" is one that we employ in our moral life quite a bit -- less so in institutional settings
		- **Reasonable**: as justifying a kind of morality, swaying someone in an argument
	- Scanlon is giving us some ammunition to counter utilitarian arguments by making it more uncomfortable to assess moral choices by calculating in the utilitarian way
		- To utilitarians: up to the contingencies of the consequences whether doing terrible things like torturing people is morally permissible. Instead, let's give the torturees the option to reject that practice on reasonable grounds
- Principles themselves: the role of the "maximin" in ordinary moral thought? Fairness often a less important value in "private" life, etc.
	- Less clear / not built into Scanlon's construction: the way to consider the people left worst off by our moral institutions
- "Philosophical foundations": qualified skepticism vs. a practical conception
	- Scanlon compares moral philosophical foundations to phil. math. -- kind of mysterious what the subject matter is! Can lead to a kind of skepticism that's interesting in moderate cases
		- Thinks he can draw on the intuitiveness of utilitarian thought but also do better than this
		- Is there an analagous interpretation in Rawls? Doesn't seem as clear
			- Seems to start with the thought: "would be a good thing if we could give a kind of prescription for thinking about the moral rules of society -- we can think of rules as unjust b/c unfair, here's a model for thinking that way!"
			- vs. Scanlon: morality itself needs to be *defended* a little more -- want to say more than socially conceived / agreed morals / values

- be careful not to put too much weight into "devices of representation" -- in both Rawls and Scanlon's views -- conditions where contracting parties come to agree on things, have conditions for agreeableness, etc.
	- controvertial in an interpretive way, b/c readers of both of these thinkers spend a lot of time thinking about the particular places in the theory, e.g. "would people actually come to agree about $X$ under this representation?" -- that's where the conclusions of the arguments lie

## Some "Philosophical" Questions/Worries
- "Philosophical" in scare quotes, b/c what does Scanlon actually mean by this?
- see slides... skipping over for now

## Some Practical (Moral/Political) Worries about Contractualism
- surely *some* parts of social life are thought of by introducing the image of unforced agreement between parties of symmetrical power
	- but how much?
	- some actual regions of social affairs have (as a *defining feature*) kinds of *asymmetry* / inequality (power, vulnerability, dependence, reliance, etc.)
		- contractualists acknowledge this, but abstract / idealize away from those features to consider what principles would be chosen (in situations that might vastly differ!)
		- some asymmetry is good, some clearly bad, but we definitely lose information when we abstract away from this
			- this really animates Charles Mills' discussion for [[PHIL 170 Lecture Notes (2022-01-27)|next time]]
