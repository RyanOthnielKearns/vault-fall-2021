# Anscombe's "Modern Moral Philosophy"
- one of the most polemical we're going to read
- still had a very strong influence on moral philosophy post-publication in 1958
	- what can we make of the main strands of the argument? what was it in the paper that changed people's minds?

# Back to Kant
## Epistemological, Metaphysical, Moral worries
Kant says the presence of an inclination to perform an action *prevents* that actions from being done from duty. So I can't be good if I'm nice?
- a moral worry

Given that you sometimes *want* to do things that are morally required, how can you ever be sure whether to assign moral worth to an action?
- an epistemological worry

*What's wrong with the sympathetic helper?*
- underneath the emphasis on "helping" is something about the helper -- the fact about them that helping feels good
- even the loving parent / compassionate person, *truly moved* out of interest for the plight of another person, does not do enough for that to count as "morally good" to Kant

### The "Battle Citation" Model
- in order to get moral "credit", I have to fight against some temptation to be bad or indifferent
- this sounds ridiculous! (objection)

### The Categorical Imperative
- why would anything so sophisticated as the CI *ever* show up in anyone's deliberation about what to do?
	- in order to act morally according to Kant we do need to hold a set of beliefs
		- must recognize a set of moral "rules" that are self-defeating to ignore or rebuke

### The moral is the most fundamental...
useful to keep in mind as we talk about [[Anscombe, G.E.M. 1958, "Modern Moral Philosophy".pdf]] and also [[Foot, Philippa 1972, "Morality as a System of Hypothetical Imperatives".pdf]]
- the next brand of philosophers we're going to read into (next 4 sessions) are *skeptics* in a sense
	- skepticism of self-interest, of moral scrutiny of our standard social conventions, etc.?
		- not for these thinkers
	- instead: skepticism in a way that's somewhat consummate to Kant's ideal of putting morality at the center of a theory
		- skeptical of moral philosophers describing + advancing a systematic approach of how we ought to live our lives / treat each other
			- you're wrong! but not because you're bringing ghostly entities into your calculus. I'm also not a rational egoist who just rejects doing anything that's non-self-interested. You also haven't made some kind of intellectual mistake...
			- instead: you're looking in the wrong place and have lost what it means to live a good human life
				- "insufficiently attuned to / reflective of" what it's actually like to be a good human being, fluorishing, etc.
			- *uniquely* a kind of moral / ethical skepticism
				- presupposes that it's worth doing philosophy to try and find out how to live our lives

# Virtue
- less emphasis on right and wrong (permissible and impermissible) *actions*, more emphasis on *virtuous* and *vicious* traits of **character**
	- abiding theme: this emphasis often comes at the *expense* of more important emphases, namely the virtuous / vicious character traits
	- **virtues** constitute distinctive *human excellences* -- ways *it is good to be* (justice, wisdom, courage)
