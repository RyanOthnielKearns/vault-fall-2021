# Dave's aside on writing papers
paper writing as a pyramid of "needs":
- Deciding what's in the paper ->
	- Ideal: try to get away with putting as little in the paper as you can
	- E.g. if the prompt asks us to raise an objection, raise a *single* objection
- Writing ->
	- 1 of the two places where you can sort of go the most wrong
- Organization ->
- Reconstruction ->
	- 2nd place where you can really go wrong
- Argument

## "Having no backhand"
- be wary of cases where you've unconsciously altered the question you're answering because you feel more confident with the alteration
	- like "running around the ball to hit it with your forehand because you have no backhand" -- that's bad

# Foreshadowing Philippa Foot
[[Foot, Philippa 1972, "Morality as a System of Hypothetical Imperatives".pdf]]
- to think about: are *we* ok with accepting morality as a system of rules basically equivalent to etiquette, but with more stringent and severe application?
	- Foot: this might be a good thing -- a distrust people have w.r.t. morality accepted in "mystical" fashion seems to go away

# First: Anscombe on Moral Obligation
[[Anscombe, G.E.M. 1958, "Modern Moral Philosophy".pdf]]
- move towards a focus on human virtue / excellence, as opposed to moral philosophy as unpacking duties & obligations
## Anscombe's complaint
- Moral Obligation & "emphatic" sense of "ought" is just a *vestige of the **divine law conception of ethics***
	- wherein theories about how to live our lives are handed down by the divine / God(s)
	- without God, these concepts retain their "mesmeric" force, but not their "meaning" (so called "conceptual orphans")
		- interesting that Anscombe herself was also a Catholic, discussed [[PHIL 170 Lecture 13 Notes - G.E.M. Anscombe, "Modern Moral Philosophy" (2022-02-15)|last time]]
- "sorry state of moral philosophy" comes from failing to recognize this, and trying to analyze / systematize this set of concepts that should really just be abandoned
	- consequentalism and Christio-Judean ethics inherently contradict (the latter operates via "commandments")
- instead of right / wrong ("emphatic ought") we should focus on justice / injustice, honesty / dishonesty, cruelty, wisdom, etc
	- don't go *all the way back to Athens* so to speak, but draw on these virtues of character cultivated / theorized about in that time

## Hume on is / ought
from Hume, *A Treatise of Human Nature* (3.1.1., pp. 28)
also in [SEP](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume/#MorRatCriPhaTre)
- moving from "is" and "is not" to "ought" and "ought not" statements
- Hume's problem about is / ought: the worries of a modern moral philosopher in that there's some special sense of *ought* tied to morality / supposed connection to motivation
	- how did we get to an *ought* / a statement about one's motivation from some set of facts?
	- Anscombe: we are much less bothered by moves from "is" statements to "needs" statements, or to "owes" statements
		- *this should be our model for unpacking the virtues*: ought is not "mesmerically forceful", but rather much more mundane, tied to the sort of recognition of what thing I am and what sort of things I am moved by, and need in order to thrive
			- "the good man is honest and just" via explaining how honesty / justice constitute human thriving
- if there's an "air of mystery" surrounding why/how we're moved by considerations of honesty or justice, this is due to an inadequacy in our basic psychological concepts
	- what are we doing with *wanting*, *intending*, *desiring*?
	- These should be able to make clear honesty / justice etc
	- and they'd come from a focus in the philosophy of psychology

# Philippa Foot's "Morality as a System of Hypothetical Imperatives"
## The target
- like [[PHIL 170 Lecture 14 Notes - Philippa Foot, "Morality as a System of Hypothetical Imperatives" (2022-02-17)#Anscombe's complaint|Anscombe]] -- focus on the "mesmeric" force of moral obligation
- targets Kant with her paper, but should be applied to really *anyone* who thinks that moral arguments have this sort of special force to them, or a special inescapable status
	- e.g. that moral arguments provide reasons for action for *anyone*
	- this "fugitive" thought needs to be questioned and ultimately rejected
		- *also*: there's little downside to abandoning the inescapability of moral thought! we can preserve the important role of morality in human life
		- when questioned as to whether the moral force of, e.g., honesty holds up, we can answer with why it's a good thing -- it does have more force than simple rules of etiquette like using the right fork for a salad
		- this is better than provoking a type of distrust in "mystical" moral rules

## Categorical vs. hypothetical
"if you want to run a marathon, you must train"
- these hypothetical imperatives have categorical (grammatical) form
### Categorical *form* vs. reason-giving *force*
"you must pass the port to the left", or "you must not bring ladies into the smoking room"

## Giving up "inescapable" morality
- this is very much moral bedrock for Kant
	- "mere conformity to law as such, without having as its basis some law determine for certain actions, is what serves the will as its principle, and *must so serve it*, if duty is not to be *everywhere an empty delusion* and a chimerical concept" (Kant in Groundwork)
	- also Nagel: "it is natural to suppose that principles of this [inescapable] sort *must underlie ethics*, *if it exists*"
		- the foundation of ethics if we can theorize about it ought to be these inescapable principles
### The stakes
- should we assume that rational inquiry will aim at what is moral? doesn't seem appropriate to take as given
- "contingent morality"
