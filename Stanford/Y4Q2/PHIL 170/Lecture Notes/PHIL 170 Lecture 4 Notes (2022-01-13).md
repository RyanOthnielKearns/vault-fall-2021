On John Taurek's [[Taurek, John M. 1977, "Should the Numbers Count?".pdf|"Should the Numbers Count?"]]

# The end of the Williams Discussion
From [[PHIL 170 Lecture 3 Notes (2022-01-11)|last time]]...

- parts of William's arguments about **negative responsibility** -- something deeply peculiar (morally speaking) about treating the actions of other people as random occurrences in the world, akin to random natural effects
	- utilitarian calculus is peculiar to our own moral emotions -- a kind of unappealing way of thinking about our own feelings / emotions (guilt, regret, pride, shame, approvalm etc.)

## Projects and Committments
- the last bit
- the particular things around which an individual organizes her own life -- meaningful to *her* (the particular person that she is)
	- *some* of these are moral -- just because meaningful to *her* doesn't mean they're entirely selfish, partial, or self-regarding
	- but some will be *partial*
- for utilitarianism to make sense at all, there must be these types of projects & committments -- these are the *subject matter over which the utilitarian calculus has to range* (basic source of human happiness / meaning)
	- for my life to go well = to have a range of projects / committments over which I devote my efforts
	- *yet* for the utilitarian, relation to her own projects / committments are conditioned by the moral demands of the theory (you're permitted to pursue these projects subject to the demands of utilitarianism)
		- this feels weird & verging on self-defeatism
- **diagnosis**: utilitarianism is supposed to be about happiness, yet it recommends a weird relation to one's potential sources of happiness
	- to the extent that a person views her own projects / committments as utilitarianism suggests she should, she'll have trouble finding them meaningful & fulfilling

## Utilitarianism...
**Smart**: as the sole rational aim of each individual in action
**Rawls**: as needing to limit itself
**Williams**: as an attack on one's own integrity
...
**Taurek**: as a peculiar way to show equal concern for everyone
- feels a little plodding / artificial ("swamp men cases" where people spring up into weird decisions they have to make)
	- but what's actually going on is this deep objection to the way utilitarianism considers their own view as equally concerned with everyone
	- that thing they're doing is not actually showing equal concern to all

next time: **Nagel**: as incompatible with absolute prohibitions on certain actions / means

# Taurek
## Trade-offs
In some situations, must choose to bestow benefits / prevent harms to some rather than others, and we cannot do both or serve all
- common answer pre-Taurek: you are **obligated** to give the drug to the five rather than the one (because Utilitarianism)
	- thinking about how tragedies make the news: not when 2 people have died, but 20, 200, ...
	- something powerful in our moral calculus that responds to numbers
	- Taurek denies: you are *not* obligated to give the drug to the five rather than the one
		- in general, numbers are not *in themselves* important when considering trade-offs
		- what Taurek would do: flip a coin, giving each person an equal chance of being benefitted

## Argument
1. In situation where you know the one person (David), it's permissible to give the drug to him rather than the five strangers (*assumption or sub-argument*)
	- maybe not morally preferred, but not morally condemned at least
	- follows from the argument that David *himself* would not be obligated to sacrifice himself (if he were the owner of the drug)
	- if David is allowed to save himself, surely David's friends are allowed morally to save David on his behalf
2. The fact that you know and like someone should not generally override a moral obligation (*observation*)
3. So, you never had the moral obligation in the first place (*follows from 1 and 2*)
4. So you wouldn't be morally obliged to give the drug to the five rather than the one, whether or not you knew and liked the one (*conceptual analysis*)

## When *do* the numbers count?
- perhaps when there's duty-bounding, e.g. the coast guard officer who must choose to save the many over the few
	- the resource (coast guard) is shared by everyone, so there's *equal claim* to the shared resource
- not that the numbers *per se* are doing the moral work -- it's a hypothetical agreement beforehand that the numbers *should* count in cases like these
	- hypothetical agreement or *actual* agreement? (Dave's question)

### Implications beyond the sheer numbers argument
- not the trade-offs in lives, but, say, one person losing a limb vs. another person losing their life
	- reasoning in an analagous way: one wouldn't be obligated to sacrifice one's limb to save another's life

## Interpreting the irrelevance of the numbers
- why are people drawn into this view? what temptation are they responding to, and how is it mistaken?
	- committment to show concern to everyone is a kind of bedrock moral committment to the utilitarian (and kind of to everyone)
		- Taurek: to misunderstand the currency of value in moral decisions -- it's like we're thinking of people as if their value is the value of things (and can be enhanced / diminished / computed)
			- People *suffer* losses and *experience* the bad things that happen to them
			- A statue can also lose an arm, but this is a diminishing of value that's not *bad for the statue* -- the statue doesn't suffer those things in any real sense
			- When it comes to things like statues, maybe it *does* make sense to pile them together and talk about what's good / bad *for the pile*
				- But for people, it seems less clear what we would mean if we talked about good for / bad for \[ some arbitrary collection of people \]
				- The loss of *your* life is a tragedy for *you* -- "Dave's tragedy for Dave is greater than Jorah's tragedy for Dave"
				- But who's the subject for which "Dave's tragedy for Dave is greater than Jorah's tragedy for Jorah" is a perspective that makes sense
