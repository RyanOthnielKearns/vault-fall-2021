# What's the central distinction between Rawls and Smart?
- Rawls zooms out and looks at the general rule-following practices, while Smart thinks that individuals can sort of game-theoretically consider others' reactions to their actions
	- Thinking at the level of a society (the "classical" utilitarians) vs. thinking at the level of the individual (apply the standard of utility directly)
- Rule consequentialism vs. act consequentialism
	- To raise intelligibly "was this action justified?" -- can't even raise the question if you think about the action *in a certain way* (associated with a rule)
- Whether, as utilitarians, it is advisable or even permissible to employ the utilitarian calculus in these rule-following tokens
- Smart's commentary is actually quite scathing, unlike Rawls
	- Task in moral philosphy is to give an extremely precise, rigorous account of how we ought to act
	- Smart thinks that people acting in these common-sensical ways is in a sense making a deep mistake
	- Whereas Rawls: it would be a bad thing for the utilitarian project if it delivered contradictory advice to the common-sense thinking -- so let's provide a framework to assuage those worries

# Utilitarianism's Centrality
- as a moral doctrine, however worked out, has a kind of magnetism in philosophy
	- "To later generations, much of the moral philosphy of the twentieth century will look like a struggle to *escape* from utilitarianism" (Christine Korsgaard)
	- "Utilitarianism occupies a central place in the moral philosophy of our time" (Scanlon)
- Rawls uses utilitarianism as an illustration; Smart is really the only full-blooded utilitarian we look at

## Background on Utilitarianism
- Standard of value (**utility**) -- something to do with pleasure or happiness
	- The more of it, the better!
- Standard of *action*: the *best* action is the one that least to the greatest amount of pleasure / happiness
	- Utilitarianism is a kind of **Consequentialism**
- May or may not imply a *principle of choice*: we'd use it in *making* choices / *deciding*
	- Choose your actions by determining which will produce the greatest pleasure/happiness for the greatest number ("optimific")

## Two Objections to Utilitarianism
1. Often gets the wrong result when it comes to **punishment**
	- you can get a lot from letting a guilty person go free, or by punishing an innocent
2. Often errs also with **promises**
	- breaking a promise might let you do a little more good than keeping it

- these conclusions seem contrary to common sense; grounds for rejection?
- utilitarian response is not to bite the bullet, but rather: "recalculate!"
	- the sum of utility does not *actually* support breaking a promise / harming the innocent
	- but the reply is *facially implausible*:
		1. implausible -- a lot of people, descriptively, actually *do* make bad decisions with a calculus somewhat like this
			- think about lying -- society continues even though people are lying all of the time
		2. rather vague and underwhelming
		3. not clear if it makes sense "logically" (what Rawls is suggesting)
		4. to even see it as an open question that the optimal action *could have been otherwise* is to weaken the decision you make
			- e.g. if your roommate decides not to murder you every morning because they write up a pros and cons list and decide based on the consequences
- the *structure of the dialectic*:

### "Biting Bullets"
- maintaining positions that run contrary to common sense
- Two examples from the history of philosophy:
	1. Mill & Harry Taylor in *The Subjection of Women*
		- the "naturalness" of the subordination of women in society was common sense, but indefensible on utilitiarian grounds
	2. Singer in "Famine, Affluence, and Morality"
		- helping people in dire need is an option or a point of charity, according to common sense -- so much for common sense!
- Has to be something about the *substance* of common sense that carries the weight in argument!

- the utilitarian defender has to dig in their heels in *some* places -- can't just describe in some way why what everyone already thinks is correct
	- most utilitarians want to *avoid* the implication that their view endorses punishing the innocent or breaking promises
	- virtue: a tremendous amount of clarity as to what decision would be the *right* one
	- at the same time: a kind of uncertainty with that clarity: how can we possibly hope to calculate the utility of a decision? we always have to hedge at some point to some degree...

# Rawls in [[Rawls, John 1955, "Two concepts of rules".pdf|"Two concepts of rules"]]
## Three Related Aims
- first unpacking what goes on in Rawls' paper

1. To *explain* the difference btwn justifying a practice vs. an action falling under it
2. Show the distinction important by showing how Utilitarians can appeal to it to answer objections
	- the utilitarian can better defend her view by making this distinction
3. Account for why people tend to overlook the difference ( using two conceptions of rules, the *summary* conception vs. the *practice* conception)
	- missing that the practice conception is the important conception when considering utilitarian arguments
	- whether Smart is guilty of conflating the distinction in his own paper (in only considering particular actions defensible)

## Rule-Following as a "Practice"
- this "practice" conception defines a *structure*: offices, roles, moves, penalties, defenses, etc.
- the justification of an action *within the practice* is a matter of appealing to the *rules of the practice*
	- whereas utilitarian concerns aim at the practice *as a whole*

## Why have practices at all?
- "the attempt to coordinate behavior by trying to foresee how others will act" (Rawls 24)
- "a practice necessarily involves the abdication of full liberty to act on utilitarian and prudential grounds" (Rawls 24)
	- various (recognizably good) things we want to do are just not possible if we don't put ourselves under the rules of practices
- Motivating example: Hume's farmers (*Treatise of Human Nature* book 3 part 2)
	- Your corn is ripe today, mine in two weeks. I can help you now *provided* you help me in two weeks and we can both benefit
	- With common knowledge, we *can't* cooperate on the harvest if we don't have a rule
	- We need a rule! We *cannot* choose our actions via answering "What would be best for me *right now*?"
		- The "assurance" rule -- once you assure you will reciprocate, you're no longer at liberty to reevaluate your decision
		- Punishment, conceived as deterrence, works the same way

## The "menu items" for utilitarianism
- The menu items are the three bullets in the [[PHIL 170 Lecture 2 Notes (2022-01-06)#Background on Utilitarianism|"Background" section]]
- Rawls thinks we *shouldn't* use utilitarianism as a standard of action (for particular actions) *or* a principle of choice

# Smart in [[J.J.C. Smart 1950, "Extreme and Restricted Utilitarianism".pdf|"Extreme and Restricted Utilitarianism"]]
- reasoning to act by saying "this action is a member of a class of actions that are usually optimific" sounds peculiar
	- are these *actually* the reasons Rawls thinks we have when we act on a practice?
		- "I did it because I promised, and when you make a promise you don't get to change your mind -- you don't have that authority"
			- Smart: ... that's just superstition! You're worshipping the rules!

## Promises, Vows, Laws, Property
- someone accepting Smart's Extreme Utilitarianism always sees herself as having the practical authority to decide what to do
	- Maybe there's a kind of *epistemic deference*: might not have all the information or might think we'll be biased, so we defer to the epistemic authority of the rule
- but... what would a society of extreme utilitarians work? how would they make promises, have property rights, pass laws, etc?
	- would they need to...?
	- kind of talking people back into Hume's "state of nature"
		- actually a *very* significantly different society would result if we truly adopt Smart's view

# Group Discussion
- is the "asking for a fourth strike" example actually relevant? seems like breaking a promise is *actually* an allowed move in the "game"...
	- are these types of gameified examples misleading for Rawls' point?
	- bascially Rawls is saying "We're not playing Calvinball here"
- where is the governing authority for the game of promise-making?
	- maybe if I break a promise I'm not "playing promise-making", but so what? I still think I'm a utilitarian
