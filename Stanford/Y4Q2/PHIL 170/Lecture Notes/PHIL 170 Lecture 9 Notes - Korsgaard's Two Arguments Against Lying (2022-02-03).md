# Deontology
Kantian ethics, continuing from [[PHIL 170 Lecture 8 Notes (2022-02-01)|last time]]
- evaluating actions *themselves* as right/wrong, rather than their consequences
- some actions are simply *wrong in themselves*
- central tenets
	- practical reason
	- freedom
	- autonomy
	- responsibility
- Korsgaard: the utility of Kant's ethical theory is in teaching us how to *use* concepts (and moreover, to *justify* our use of them -- why are those concepts *correct* for the purposes of our own thinking?)
	- this is someting the faculty does -- it uses concepts (a sort of analagous thing to the Rawlsian "cookbook" for a just society, but as applied to individual, ethical human actions)

## Practical Reason
we *choose* our actions through deliberation. This makes human actions special
- we don't just *do* what we feel like doing, nor do we pick *arbitrarily*
	- weighing, reflecting w/ the mind, judging, etc.
	- not all beings who act are able to deliberate in this way that humans do!
		- dogs, e.g., act in a more instinctual way, in ways built into their nature
- *practical* reasoning is practical in its issue
	- *is* something in itself which results in action
	- Aristotle: "the conclusion of a practical syllogism is an action"
	- powers & faculties
		- e.g. plants have the *power* to grow (other objects do not have this power)
		- humans have this *power* where we navigate the world through our powers of reason
- to Kant, when you think about what to do, you "idealize yourself" -- think of yourself as a reasoner (Dave)
	- yet: in a Kantian way there is an understanding that you will sometimes choose actions imperfectly -- in the moment of reasoning you have to be rational / idealized, yet it is possible to think of oneself as morally compromised *in moments* (e.g., throwing away the key to the liquor cabinet in a moment of clarity)
	- the nature of the concept doesn't work in this way, like thinking about action in any sort of *imperfect* way ("useful but false pretense")
- practical concepts, to Kant, are not for describing any particular way the world is *like* -- instead, they're to be utilized in a way of thinking about *what to do* s.t. those ways of thinking are correct in their own standard
	- Korsgaard's concept of "legitimacy" -- taking tons of input from the world when assessing whether a given political candidate is "legitimate" -- but we're not checking for legitimacy in the same way we would determine whether this given quadroped is a zebra
		- whether or not to *do $X$* depending on whether legitimacy (of the state, of the candidate, etc.) applies
- reasoning can be done well or poorly
	- doing it well is a matter of what *rules* we are to follow as for what to think: musts, can'ts, etc.
	- starting with an intuitive bedrock about things like *logical contradictions*
	- one way to reason poorly is to *fail to take the means to your own ends*, regardless of whether the ends themselves are good
		- if you do this, you're making some sort of mistake!
		- the *same* sort of mistake as making a logical contradiction
		- Harry Frankfurt: "The essence of rationality is to be consistent; and being consistent, in action or in thought, means proceeding so as not to defeat oneself..." (==is this not circular? From contradiction actually *everything* follows, not nothing at all...==)
	- *another* way to reason badly is to have the wrong "ends"
		- **ends** are roughly what I aim at in action (not the same thing (not necessarily) as what I aim to produce / bring about / realize)
		- there are positive ends
		- to Kant: others are to show up in my thinking in such a way that they are other persons, who have their own ends
			- if I fail to do that, I will have embroiled myself in some sort of contradiction
			- think of contradiction in the Frankfurt sense, e.g. "acting in some ways against myself or in self-defeating ways"
			- what does Kant take himself to have endeavored to show? -- there is a kind of *contradiction* we take on when we think of other people as not showing up in my thinking in that type of way (as ends in themselves)

## Freedom
- in order for our reasoning to make any difference, we must be **free** to determine our actions through the exercise of reason
	- what kind of freedom is this?
	- maybe one can regard others, or even *oneself*, as entirely predictable via one's desires, feelings, inclinations, etc. -- before or after the fact
		- but during the action itself -- in the act of choosing -- it is *not possible* to regard oneself in this way
		- when I am regarding myself as a *person* rather than a thing -- "committed" to regarding myself as free
		- to see *others* as persons is thus to be committed to seeing them as free to choose

*is it a problem (for Kant) that morality depends on free will?*
