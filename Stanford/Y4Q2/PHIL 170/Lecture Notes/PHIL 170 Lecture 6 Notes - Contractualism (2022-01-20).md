# Contractualism: "Justice as Fairness" by John Rawls
- the paper [[Rawls, John 1958, "Justice as Fairness".pdf]]
- draws a lot on the main idea from [[Rawls, John 1955, "Two concepts of rules".pdf]] (discussed in [[PHIL 170 Lecture 2 Notes (2022-01-06)#Rawls in John Rawls 1955 Two concepts of rules pdf Two concepts of rules]])

## "Potted" History of Contractualism
- a bit harder to get your head around than utilitarianism

- Plato & the Sophists (discussion w/ Socrates): contractualism as a doctrine to be *refuted*
	- Thrasimicus -- cynical take on how people "buy in" to a system of rules -- systemic rational thinkers wouldn't see any reason to appeal to authority whatsoever!
		- Glaucon and Adamantus -- advance a counterargument that "the structure of society's rules aren't a means for others to exercise power over you. Instead, a *mutually beneficial agreement* among parties who don't have the power / position to reliably overpower you"
	- Plato's republic is very much not egalitarian by design ("certain people being naturally better to rule")
		- Rawls builds out a doctrine of contractualism that holds participants on equal playing field
- discussion: justice as a kind of self-interested contractual fabric? Is this what we think is central to morality? Is everyone really only out for their self-interest?
	- At one extreme: position that tries to *root* morality in *rational self-interest* -- "I'm just out for me and mine. BUT I'm not able to dominate everybody and can sometimes be dominated by others"
		- So it's best to draw up a covenant of sorts and lay down a set of rules *in light of* a rational self-interest
		- We're not a society of *saints* with our motives all towards one common goal
		- We're also not a society of degenerates who will cheat and steal at every opportunity
		- Our conception of morality has to lay somewhere in the middle
		- Brushing away questions of realism vs. anti-realism: this is a good way of thinking about morality that you'll adopt upon reflection. It's not about whether these ideas are "enscribed in Plato's heaven" or not
	- The rebuttal: that doesn't seem central to morality
- Next after Plato: **Social Contract Theorists** of the Englightenment
	- Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Kant
		- Locke takes as his direct opponent Filmer -- for anyone  familiar with the history of philosophy it makes sense that his work is no longer read anymore, because his view is by our modern liberal sensibilities BANANAS
	- The social contract = the origin & justification of the state and its coercive authority
		- All different versions of social contract theory have this opinion in common
	- Locke: instead of a rational self-interest guiding the adoption of these contracts, there's an *independent source of morality* laid down by *God*
		- only practical way of *observing* that moral authority is to put ourselves under a social contract
		- deeply socially indepenendent creatures that have no shot except for living in a society with others
- Contractualism in the 20th century: Rawls, Scanlon, Gauthier
	- contract as an attractive basis for our social life together

### Early Objections from David Hume
for most of us, we're just born into a society and learn to accept the rules...
- nevertheless, there's a meaningful sense in which people are "argreeing" to the terms of the society (contractualists)
- Hume's point:
	- "this is like saying that somebody smuggled aboard a ship *consents* to be on the ship because they're not willing to jump overboard into shark infested waters"
	- also: "at the foundation of all of these views is the assumption that *voluntarily made agreements genuinely bind people* -- that there's some kind of moral force"
		- "if that's obvious, it requires an explanation of its obviousness, at least"
		- what if I no longer want to follow them, or it becomes unwise to do so?
			- social contract theorists assume that there ought to be a good explanation for this -- but where is it?

## The structure of contractualist theories
"A way of determining *principles* and justifying following them using the device of some (imagined) contract"
- **contract** = an unforced agreement among parties w/ more or less equal power who will abide by whatever principles they choose
- I feel like ==device of some (imagined) contract== is confusing -- how necessary is the device to the principles aforementioned??
- as the way we will use to evaluate existing social practices -- "choosing society's rules" in this way might validate or invalidate any number of existing social practices
	- shouldn't be an objection *per se* that the actual social rules / motivational tendencies don't line up perfectly, because Rawl's force is in a kind of theoretical justification

1. to what do the principles apply? what do they regulate?
	- Rawls: to the basic institutions of society
	- the principles of *justice*
2. how should we envision the contracting parties? (aims, motivations, standards for agreement)
	- Rawls: imagine a group of people evaluate social practices that are "already online"
	- parties are "mutually self-interested": allegiance to the practices are founded on the prospect of self-advantage
		- also rational: entering in on the basis of a decent amount of knowledge *and not overly **envious***
	- in circumstances where cooperation makes sense (there's moderate scarcity and similarly complementary needs / wants)
3. which principles are chosen?
	1. maximally extensive, equal, basic liberties
	2. differences in the distribution of benefits / burdens of cooperation are only justified to the extent they're advantageous to everyone

... the **Duty of Fair Play**
- a "basic moral notion" like fidelity and gratitude
- "implies a limitation on their pursuit of self-interest in particular cases" ([[Rawls, John 1958, "Justice as Fairness".pdf]] p. 183)
