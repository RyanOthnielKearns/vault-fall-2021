*Prompt*: What is the problem that a “practice” of promising or punishment (choose one) solves? Explain the difference between the two conceptions of rules that Rawls presents in his paper.  Why won’t a “rule of thumb” (that states e.g. “keep your promises” or “punish only the guilty”) solve the problem?  How does the construal of the rule _as a rule of a practice_ do better?  Is there any difficulty that you can see with construing these rules as rules of practices, which in turn are justified on _utilitarian_ grounds?

Rereading [[Rawls, John 1955, "Two Concepts of Rules" (annotated).pdf]]

# Beginning with the prompt as outline
which isn't the final proposed outline, but a way to start making sure I'm addressing the prompt in it's totality...
- going to start with [[PHIL 170 Lecture 2 Notes (2022-01-06)]] as a start, where we first discussed [[Rawls, John 1955, "Two concepts of rules".pdf]]

## Explain the difference between the two conceptions of rules that Rawls presents in his paper
- this is just a reconstruction of the practice vs. summary conceptions of rules argument that Rawls brings up in his paper

## Why won’t a “rule of thumb” solve the problem?
- Rawls' argument is one of logical precedence (revisit this [[Rawls, John 1955, "Two Concepts of Rules" (annotated).pdf|in the paper?]])

## How does the construal of the rule _as a rule of a practice_ do better?
- This construal of the rule as a practice saves us from the traditional objections to utilitarianism having to do with punishment and promises

## Is there any difficulty that you can see with construing these rules as rules of practices, which in turn are justified on _utilitarian_ grounds?
- want to argue that adherence to the practice conception isn't a free lunch -- while you might walk away with a better utilitarian defense of punishment or promising, you have the extra added burden of so called "rule-worship" per [[J.J.C. Smart 1950, "Extreme and Restricted Utilitarianism".pdf]]
- we might also want to ask ourselves -- is *every* action one corresponding to a practice? if you justify non-optimific actions because they correspond to non-optimific practices, what kind of place do you find yourself in when you encounter novel types of actions? do you have any strong utilitarian basis for choosing to act optimifically, if your standard for calculation is placed at the level of practices only?
- another angle: there doesn't appear to be any space in Rawls' conception for *dissent* against a practice one determines unjust
	- also, the notion of an "institution" setting the practices is much more complex in real life than it is for a game of baseball, and this makes the dissent problem all the worse off
- The "institution" setting / establishing practices is hard to get at in the general societal case
- There's a notion of information loss in how optimific

==a question for Dave can be about getting clear about this "no free lunch" argument -- how exactly should I spell out Smart's "rule worship" objection within Rawls' framework?==

# Notes from meeting with Dave
- if "keep your promises" was only a summary rule, then "keep your promises" would not work in a way that would work from a utilitarian perspective
	- maybe Rawls does not say very explicitly why that is
	- Hume's "two farmers" example -- Rawls may have had this in mind though it's not clear whether it's "in" the paper
- why are the rules of practices the way they are? people can disagree under Rawl's account of practice
- did Rawls' baseball example become a "flashpoint of controversy" for the theory? Not really
	- idea of practices *does* become significant for the Rawlsian project
- institution: *collection of social facts that define the practice*
- paper says very little about the moral status of *actually existing practices*
	- any comment about the morality of a move either within or without of an existing practice -- relegated to utilitarianism for the purposes of this paper
- discussion on practices on pp. 26 - 27
- the institution of promise-making is something we all participate in -- compare with the MLB -- a "player" in the promise-making game is also someone who's a member of the institution
	- in a pickup soccer game, there can be gray areas about how we're going to do things
	- *come up with a particular answer as to what is lost from the argument*
		- consider "Justice as Fairness" -- "we should use promising!" --> "but the exceptions are completely ad hoc, everyone who's on trial is also a judge in their own case" --> "maybe this just says that promising is a bad practice itself, not a problem with *practices*"
		- Calvinball?
		- as a problem of (1) the analysis of practices or (2) as a problem in the world
			- in justice as fairness: "design space" for practices where we can select them out of, on basis of objectivity, clarity, etc.
				- the law is a great example of what you'd get trying to turn morality into a rulebook
				- there are some cases where we want a lesser amount of rigor
				- practices being really indeterminate / loose is not a knockdown against the practice, or even having practices like this in our society
