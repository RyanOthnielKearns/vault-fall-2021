*Introduction / Abstract*: In "Two Concepts of Rules," John Rawls distinguishes between justifying a practice and justifying an action falling under that practice.

Rawls' Summary and Practice Conceptions are two ways to think about societal rules. They differ in the subject matter they put up to utilitarian considerations.

In Rawls' Summary Conception of rules, we apply the utilitarian principle directly to individual actions.

In the Practice Conception, by contrast, we apply the utilitarian principle to practices rather than individual actions.

Logical precedence is what sets these two conceptions apart.

Our justifications for social institutions like promising differ under these two conceptions.

Under the summary conception, rules governing promising are maxims we adopt after sufficient promises are made.

Under the practice conception, we consider the *institution* of promising before particular promises.

Explaining the act of promising with the Practice Conception makes it more defensible for utilitarians.

However, in Rawls' Practice Conception of promising the institution governing the practice is vaguely defined.

What results is a practice where anyone may take up the office of reformer.

In this setting, reformations to the practice are likely to cause confusion.

As a result, promisers are likely to disagree on the practice to which their justifications refer. Utilitarian justifications under the Practice Conception are made by reference to the rules of the practice. Yet no one is likely to carry identical "rulebooks" in hand.

This objection does not refute Rawlsâ€™ Practice Conception in theory, but instead may present practical difficulties.
