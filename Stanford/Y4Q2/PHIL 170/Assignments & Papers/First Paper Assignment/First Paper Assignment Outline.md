*Prompt*: What is the problem that a “practice” of promising or punishment (choose one) solves? Explain the difference between the two conceptions of rules that Rawls presents in his paper.  Why won’t a “rule of thumb” (that states e.g. “keep your promises” or “punish only the guilty”) solve the problem?  How does the construal of the rule _as a rule of a practice_ do better?  Is there any difficulty that you can see with construing these rules as rules of practices, which in turn are justified on _utilitarian_ grounds?

# Explain the difference between Rawl's "summary" and "practice" conceptions of rules
Rawls' "summary" and "practice" conceptions are two ways to think about societal rules. They differ in the subject matter they put up to utilitarian considerations.

## The "summary" conception of rules
In Rawls' "summary" conception of rules, we apply the utilitarian principle directly to individual actions.

## The "practice" conception of rules
In Rawls' "practice" conception of rules, we apply the utilitarian principle to practices rather than individual actions.

## The logical priority of practices versus the actions falling under them sets these two conceptions apart.

# Explain why the practice conception offers a better account of promising
We now turn to justifying a societal institution like punishment under these two conceptions of rules.

## Promising under the summary conception
Under the summary conception, promising is a maxim we adopt after a sufficient number of instances. In each individual case, according to Rawls, we reason like this: 

## Promising under the practice conception
Under the practice conception, we consider the *institution* of promising before particular promises.

## Choosing the practice conception to explain punishment offers a better defense of utilitarianism.

# Present a difficulty to construing rules (for promising) as rules of practices
We will now consider whether construing promising as a practice presents any difficulties.

## Unlike punishment, in the case of promising it is unclear who the institution consists of.

## We have to assume that the institution of promising includes everyone capable of promising.

## With the institution so inclusive, it is hard to see how the practice of promising evolves.


## One has to keep all exceptions to promising in mind when engaging in the practice.

## The result is a practice with extreme cognitive demands.
If we ever utter "I promise" there is reasonable likelihood that we are wrong. This result feels incorrect.

# Give Rawls the chance to reply to the objection
Rawls might reply to the above objection like this:

## Rawls' theory could concede that acknowledging every exception is not necessary for making a promise.
We can dispense with this constraint. It is much more important to promising that
