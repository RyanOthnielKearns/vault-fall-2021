*Prompt*: According to Kant, only actions done from duty have “moral worth.” Some readers of Kant have interpreted this in a way that, according to them, makes the ideal moral agent’s motivation deeply unappealing. Explain this challenge to Kant’s view of moral motivation, making use of his own examples from the Groundwork to help illustrate the issue. How, according to Barbara Herman, can the challenge be addressed? Do you find her discussion convincing, or are you still concerned about the kind of motivation that is morally desirable on Kant’s view?

# Introduction / abstract
# The challenge to Kant's view of moral motivation
To even parse this claim,

## Kant's view of moral motivation
### What good will is


### What duty is
To Kant, our conception of duty is a part of our good will that determines our actions. We sometimes act for the *sake* of duty. This means performing, or abstaining from, certain actions as the better part of ourself wills it. Kant's understanding of good will in the *Groundwork* is complex. Suffice to say that *acting for the sake of duty* involves choosing one's actions in accordinace with what is good.

### Dutiful actions have moral worth
#### But only if done *solely* for the sake of duty
##### The shopkeeper example
The shopkeeper, motivated to act for profit, may only sometimes act morally correctly. In other words, the motivation for profit is not *dependable* for producing morally correct actions. The ultimate goal for the shopkeeper is profit. This has the effect of her sometimes acting morally (not overcharging customers) and sometimes immorally ()

##### The sympathetic person example

## The challenge this poses
We often have non-moral inclinations to perform actions. I am inclined to play videos games because *it feels good*. The pleasure I receive serves as my motivation for action. Likewise, I might also be inclined to help my friend move. It also feels good to have helped a friend -- in a different way from video games, but still. So, I can say I was *motivated* to help my friend because it would feel good to have helped.

Surely, it shouldn't be a problem that helping my friend move is *also* the morally correct and dutiful thing to do.

### The sympathetic person should desire to hate his friends!
On one reading of Kant's view, it is morally preferrable to perform the same action without inclinations.

# Barbara Herman on how to address the challenge
## Most of our actions are overdetermined
## Just because the motive of duty is present, doesn't mean another motive (e.g., profit) couldn't overpower it in other circumstances
## So, we might be inclined to condition that the motive of duty can always "overpower" competing motives
## (Objection on p. 369 of Herman that I'm not yet understanding...)
## Convincing? Yes or no?
# Conclusion
