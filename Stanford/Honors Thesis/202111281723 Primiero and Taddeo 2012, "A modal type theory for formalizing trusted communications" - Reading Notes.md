- rational agents, similar to [[Taddeo 2010, "Modelling Trust in Artificial Agents, A First Step Toward the Analysis of e-Trust" - Reading Notes|Taddeo 2010]]
	- this is a limitation for the theory's relevance to describing trust as used in XAI, since they define trustworthiness as "a measure of the probability that the trustee is able to perform a given action correctly and autonomously" (94)
		- I don't think you have to think about trustworthiness *at all* -- it reduces to a quantification of $T(A, B, X, C)$ relations over multiple $A$'s for a single $B$, whereby we'd consider $B$ trustworthy in doing $X$ in context $C$
- also considers trust as a "second order relation" as in [[Taddeo 2010, "Modelling Trust in Artificial Agents, A First Step Toward the Analysis of e-Trust" - Reading Notes|Taddeo 2010's "e-trust" account]]
- about trust-qualified "communication processes" (92), which isn't quite actions but could be related (or a subset)
	- trust defined as "the result of linking two epistemic states by way of a message passing system" (93)
