- ask thomas: who should be the second reader?
	- ray briggs?
- dept regulations are super open (7.5k to 12.5k words)
- for graduate school
	- 2 things relevant to keep the door open
		- writing sample (20-25 page range)
		- even better: have a published paper
		- in both cases: something quite short! as high quality as can manage
			- 25+ pages becomes too long for both
	- should be aiming at publishable length piece in the 20 page range
