- no bold claims made in document so far
- to do right now: does getting the right definitions clarify certain prima facie tensions between them? paradigmatic analytic philosophy tensions
	- already identified a bunch of tensions / puzzles / seemingly outright conflicts in what people have said
	- already very interesting -- but more ambitiously, look at some problem already raised in the literature ("here's this thing people have been trying to do, and why they haven't been able to do it")
- Thomas curious about tension between need for explanation & trust
	- question from the recourse literature (e.g. denied credit application)
- phil. lit. seems to have less to say about the "outcomes"-related theories like Bhattacharya
	- Jorah Dannenberg's papers on Trust (from Stanford)
		- we think of trust as very much a social thing -- dynamics only work to the extent we place trust in those close to us -- *not* something we'd just want to call reliance (but also distinguished from, say, trusting a barometer)
- argument: trust *ought* to be distinguished from reliance in the "machine case", b/c otherwise conflate
- question: what is (rational/reasonable) trust in algorithmic systems such that other concepts (transparency, explanation, etc.) are helpful or conducive to trust in these systems?
	- specifically what is it to create a coherent web of concepts (assuming we keep fixed definitions for explanation / transparency / etc.)
	- on the face of it, not only is it undertheorized and ppl don't say what they mean / could mean different things, but a lot of inherent surface-level tensions seem to go unresolved
	- go for named bullet points of various strands that seem to be related (e.g. simplicity / clarity vs. performance, explanation vs. trust, transparency vs. trust)
- for next time: outline?
	- come up with a guiding question
	- take various strands you have and see how they fit into that story
	- nice, coherent, tight kind of essay is one where everything is working towards answering question or establishing claim
