Ok so... the idea is to take the extended mind thesis from Clark and Chalmers and try to evaluate its potential ethical import in the space of tech. Something like the idea that 3rd party technology considered *as part of our own minds* mandates a certain higher standard of participation in decision-making for that tech. Are there ethical guidelines made for, say, FDA approval that hinge on the fact that food and drugs are ingested and made part of oneself, rather than peripheral tools or whatnot? I'm not sure. But prima facie it seems like considering Google Search as part of my own mind, rather than another service that doesn't get that cognitive intimacy so to speak...
