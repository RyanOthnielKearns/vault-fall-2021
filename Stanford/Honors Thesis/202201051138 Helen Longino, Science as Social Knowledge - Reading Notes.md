# Preface
- originally the "negative intention" of critiquing a "value-free science" $\rightarrow$ now the more positive thesis of "developing an analysis of the scientific knowledge that reconciles the objectivity of science with its social and cultural construction" (ix)
# Chapter 1: Introduction: Good Science, Bad Science
## Motivations
- motivating question: *how do we judge the claims of science?*
	- more specifically: "How should these demonstrations and allegations of the interaction of *science* and *social values* affect our conception of *scientific knowledge*?" (3, emphasis mine)
	- Longino's aim: show how social values play a role in scientific research via scientific reasoning

## Goal of Scientific Activity
- goal of scientific activity: production of *explanations* of the natural world
	- what makes a good scientific explanation = what makes good science
	- these values (constituting good scientific methodology / practice) called **constitutive values**
- contrast with **contextual values**: personal, social, cultural values held among science practitioners
- asserting "value-free" science is asserting that constitutive and contextual values are orthogonal
	- scientific freedom from contextual values takes two forms:
		- **autonomy** of scientific inquiry: inquiry proceeds undisturbed by values / intersts from the sociocultural context
		- **integrity** of scientific inquiry: the core practices of science (observation and experiment, theory construction, and inference) are independent of the sociocultural context
			- more core & less extreme than asserting autonomy

- *is a value-laden science necessarily "bad"?*

## 3 sketches for the scientific knowledge <> contextual values interaction
1. Robert Richardson (1984): contextual values influence reasoning in only bad ways
	- Theses should be judged on account of evidence / falsifiability, not ideological incompatibility
	- Good scientific inquiry works to weed out subjective preferences in theory selection
2. Social constuctionist approach: scientific theories are products of their historical / cultural context
	- weak and strong views attacking, correspondingly, the autonomy and integrity of scientific inquiry
	- also a viewpoint in feminist thought
	- influenced widely by Kuhn's *Structure of Scientific Revolutions*
3. A mix of the two: we can achieve methodologically correct science by weeding out the "bad" scientific influences like racism and sexism
	- Donna Haraway argues against: can't suppose that any methodology would be "correct" while also suggessting that observation in science is theory-/paradigm-determined; it invites paradox

## Feminism and Marxism in Longino's approach
1. There are standards of rational acceptability that are value-independent. BUT
2. Satisfying these standards in a theory won't guarantee that the theory is value- or interest-free

- the feminist / Marxist claim: pointing out the "pervasiveness of interdependence in human societies" (12)
	- Longino's similar tack: arguing that knowledge is developed socially and not individually
		- is this similar to Hardwig (1991)? Book was published the year prior...
