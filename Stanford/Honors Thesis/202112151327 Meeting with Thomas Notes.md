# Before discussion
- talked to Katie Creel about "Transparency in Complex Computational Systems"
	- she made a point to mention the "atomic vs. relational" concept distinction, citing feminist philosophy especially -- are you aware of this / thinking about it for this project?
- also wanted to take a more logistical tone in terms of timing / deadlines for finishing the thesis over the next quarter
