Today, reading [[The One Hundred Year Study on Artificial Intelligence (AI100) 2021 Study Panel Report.pdf]]
## General check-in
*What am I doing?*
I seem to have moved tack a bit into a happier flow of reading and note-taking at will, rather than a more structured approach dissecting individual research papers one-by-one as I did in the beginning of the research process. I think this is helping me "warm back up" to the process of writing the thesis. Things will get more focused when I meet with Thomas next week and start setting some hard deadlines for components of the thesis.

As for right now, I seem to have moved into more #AI and #XAI literature, reading stuff by [[Finale Doshi-Velez]] and #Stanford-HAI. I think I'll go back into #philosophy pretty soon, and keep oscillating between the two in an effort to bring their content together in my head.
## AI100 Reading Notes
- An interesting domain of applicability: trusting content curation algorithms like newsfeeds on Facebook, Twitter, etc. -- this depends on one's intended use of the algorithm... Do you trust Facebook to give you an unbiased account of the news, or a developing story? I suppose you don't trust individual articles or media companies to do that, anyway... but if your intention is just to be entertained then the question of trusting them is kind of moot.
	- From AI100:
> Recommender systems now have a dramatic influence on peopleâ€™s consumption of products, services, and content, but they raise significant ethical concerns. (7)
- The report, at a high level, seems to be moving in some interesting directions, noting increasing popularity around ideas of collective or group intelligence, as well as human-AI teams capable of playing to each others' strengths (9)
- "The recent dominance of deep learning may be coming to an end" (10)
- AI for healthcare purposes, especially home devices giving medication reminders and chatbots helping treat PTSD (11) make questions of trust in black-box systems all the more imperative to answer
