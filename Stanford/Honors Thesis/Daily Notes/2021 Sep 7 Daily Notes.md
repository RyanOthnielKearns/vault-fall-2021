- today:
	- migrate content from PHIL 350 classwork to `honors-thesis` repo & check in via Git
	- email Thomas about setting up an initial meeting / prospect of a recurring meeting during the Fall Q
	- who's the guy teaching the PHIL seminar winter quarter on Philosophy of Artificial Intelligence? get in touch with him :)

I think something to get clear on soon is: who are the authorities in the domain in which I'm researching? How can I make sure I'm up to date with their newest publications? Maybe set up a watchlist on Semantic Scholar or something? Do researchers like Thomas and Jared have advice for this?
- Taddeo (from e.g. [[Taddeo 2010, "Modelling Trust in Artificial Agents, A First Step Toward the Analysis of e-Trust"]])?
- C. Thi Nguyen (from e.g. [[Nguyen 2021, "Trust as an Unquestioning Attitude" - Reading Notes]])?
- Tavani (from [[Tavani 2020, "Search Engines and Ethics" - Reading Notes]] and [[Buechner and Tavani 2011, "Trust and multi-agent systems- applying the 'diffuse, default approach' to experiments involving artificial agents" - Reading Notes]])
