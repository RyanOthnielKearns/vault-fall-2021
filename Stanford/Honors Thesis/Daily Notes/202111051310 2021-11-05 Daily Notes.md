- task: constellation of *coherent* operative definitions for all the things we desire from human-centered AI
	- here using "human-centered AI" as a catchall for fair/interpretable/trustworthy machine learning
- initial puzzle
	- trust and transparency, at least, seem foundationally opposed, and yet there's an assumption that they're acquired through the same technical toolkit
		- if the tension  between the two isn't resolved, it would seem impossible that any one technique could yield both
		- transparency is a kind of "surveillance" ([[Nguyen 2021, "Transparency is Surveillance".pdf|Nguyen 2021]])
		- trust is a kind of "unquestioning attitude" ([[Nguyen 2021, "Trust as an Unquestioning Attitude" - Reading Notes|]])
