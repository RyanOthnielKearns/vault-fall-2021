## _What is preflight?_
I'm trying something new today! I've been working on this thesis for a bit over a month now, and am still experimenting with making the research process more rigorous. Basically, how can I unlock additional quality output through routine?

I had one idea in this vein recently, and so I'm starting a "preflight" routine. Every day I intend to do significant work on the thesis, I'll begin and end with ~10 minute freewrites, called "preflight" and "postflight" respectively. I want to keep all holds barred for these writing sessions, and focus on stream-of-consciousness exploration of
1. where I am with the research process, and
2. where I intend to go with the day's work.

The postflight will have a similar tone, but should focus instead on
1. what I learned in my research block, and
2. where I want to go from this point.

I think combined, preflight and postflight freewrites will be a valuable resource to look back to in order to revive threads and research questions, and in general revisit sources and philosophical ideas in their various stages of formation. Also, it gets me writing, which is a plus. I'm not very good at that :)

## _So, where am I?_
I ended my last research session with a summary of [[Tavani 2020, "Search Engines and Ethics" - Reading Notes|Tavani's 2020 SEP article, "Search Engines and Ethics"]]. I think this locus is interesting but a bit tangential to my thesis topic, as I wrote:
> Will I really be using this article heavily in the scope of the honors thesis? Probably not -- search engines are interesting but not the true literary focus of the project.

So, why read it? I reference at the end (in the **Discussion on Trust** section of the notes) that Tavani had dropped some good sources about developing "e-trust", or trust in settings involving distributed, digital, or generally non-human agents. I think I owe the "e-trust" phrase to [[Taddeo 2010, "Modelling Trust in Artificial Agents, A First Step Toward the Analysis of e-Trust"]], which I read in PHIL 359 (and should read again!) -- but I will have to check.

For my thesis I am particularly interested in how digital agents like AI systems may posess _trustworthiness_, and how we can go about assessing this quality in things other than humans. As such, this is relevant literature! In particular Tavani mentions
- [[Walker 2006]] as a starting point, and
- [[Buechner and Tavani 2011, "Trust and multi-agent systems- applying the 'diffuse, default approach' to experiments involving artificial agents" - Reading Notes]], which goes into much more specific detail in the "multi-agent system" case.

So, I have these in my backlog of papers to read.

## _And where am I going?_
I'm honestly a bit disappointed in the speed of my progress -- I think I should look to solidify my notes around trust from a traditionally philosophical perspective pretty soon. This means annotating well-referenced pieces like [[Annette Baier 1986, "Trust and Antitrust" - Reading Notes|Baier, 1986]], and the rest of the sources outlined in [[McLeod 2015, "Trust" - Reading Notes|McLeod's 2015 survey of trust]] in the SEP. I'll work through Baier and a second citation from McLeod -- which I'm just realizing, I did a shitty job notating! Might want to revisit that strategically as I grab more sources from the bibliography there.
