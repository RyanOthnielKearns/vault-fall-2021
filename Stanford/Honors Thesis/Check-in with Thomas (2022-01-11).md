- making a proposal about the structure of "instance-based trust" is
	- these are all the moving parts that comprise an instance of trust
- low-level stuff
	- $C$ as a set of atomic formulas (predications (one-place predicates) as well as functions, defined by their domain and range -- make sure the way you define $f$ is not "offensive")
	- to put the last LaTeX into the object language: just like how conditionals / counterfactuals are expressed in the object language
- different things you could do with a formalization
	1. think of some interesting formal problems that come up with trust and then solve those
	2. form a conceptual point that you want to convince people of
	3. show how to unify a bunch of different discussions happening in different places into a single format so they can be put into conversation together
		- e.g. Jeff Horty on "understanding precendence reasoning in the law"
- bar will be: do you shed light on the issue? do you clarify / present in such a way that other ppl would find useful?
	- bottom line for philosophy: does someone gain insight from the paper?
	- have to reliably get that kind of effect in the reader
- map out the different views & how they fit into this framework -- what does this look like? space of choices for different primitives
- "universal quantification"
