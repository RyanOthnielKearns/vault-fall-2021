## Summary
This paper advances a view on trust that differs from the more popular philosophical accounts. Specifically, Nguyen moves away from the idea that trusting requires assigning *complete agencial states* to the trusted. Instead, trust is defined as adopting an *"unquestioning attitude"*, in which we suspend deliberation and allow things to functionally integrate with our own agency. Key here is the idea that non-agents, like parts of the body, a smartphone, or the ground, can count as artifacts one trusts.

More technically, Nguyen defines: to "trust X to P" is to:
1. be first-order disposed to immediately accept that X will P, and
2. to be second-order disposed to deflect questions about whether X will P.

This two-tiered approach mirrors Michael Bratman's account of #intentions and #resolutions, specifically the idea of "cognitive inertia". Note in particular that the unquesitoning attitude doesn't mean one will never question, just that one is generally disposed not to question.

Fundamentally, Nguyen thinks that we trust in order to expand our agency by functionally integrating pieces of the external world. There is too much information in the world for one agent to account for all at once; therefore, we are required to trust and hold the unquestioning attitude towards some things. Nguyen's paper includes many references to modern #technology, which we "rely on" in a very particular way, characteristic of this account of trust. Nguyen defines the term **technological gullibility** as the disposition to too readily and irrationally integrate new technologies into one's agency.

## Reading Notes
- most theories of #trust in philosophy = *conscious* attitude, directed towards *other agents*
	- required: that the truster ascribes #agency (or some agencial state) to the trusted
- Nguyen's counterproposal: trust as suspending deliberation
	- key: we can hold this *unquestioning attitude* towards non-agents, like parts of oneself, technologies, the ground, etc.
		- we can revoke this attitude, but if we're trusting, we had better be at least basically dispositioned to not question
	- by suspending deliberation, in trusting we allow things "inside" to play a more direct role in our cognition / activity
		- about *functional integration*, and expanding our agency (related: the #extended-mind)
		- related to cognitive and general #intimacy
	- *to trust X to P* = "to have a first-order disposition to immediately accept that X will P, and a second-order disposition to deflect questioning about the first-order disposition" (15)
- key indication of trust is the *possibility of betrayal* ==> this distinguishes trust from "mere reliance"
- **agencial #gullibility**: when we too readily or irrationally integrate external processes into our own agency
	- specifically, there is **technological gullibility**, where people are too quick or irrational in adopting new pieces of technology into their agency
- motivated with modern #technology, which we relate to in a particular way that Nguyen calls trust
	- we functionally integrate, e.g., Google search into our cognition and goals as agents
- Nguyen's linguistic argument:
	1. our natural use of "trust" involves the unquestioning attitude
	2. our natural use of "betrayal" involves being disappointed by artifacts we had previously held the unquestioning attitude towards
- important: the artifacts that we trust can run beyond our (or anyone's) ability to understand or control
	- there is more information in the world than is possible for a single agent to grasp at once -- we are *required* to suspend deliberation in some cases and trust
- big idea: this account could point towards the efficacy of a more generally radical **non-individualist #epistemology**

## Summary
In "Trust as an Unquestioning Attitude", C. Thi Nguyen establishes an additional theory of trust to accompany philosophy's typically agent-oriented theories. Most previous theories of trust hold only between agents, involve central requirements like goodwill, responsiveness, or reliance on committments, and are marked by the possibility of betrayal.

Nguyen, by contrast, establishes a theory of trust based on an **unquestioning attitude** -- by this theory, to trust something is to have a strong disposition to suspend deliberation about that thing. For example, a climber trusts their climbing rope, because they aren't constantly reassuring themselves as to the rope's integrity. By contrast, to *distrust* is to remain in a state of constant questioning and skepticism.

Nguyen claims that both theories of trust -- the general agent-oriented theory and the unquestioning attitude theory -- sit under an umbrella for a more general notion of trust, and that what joins them is their purpose of expanding one's agency through integrating aspects of the external world. In this sense, we trust so to form linkages or "welds" to external objects, and we bring them into our practical and cognitive faculties. For this reason, we can talk of being *betrayed* in our trust even of non-agents, like musical instruments or the ground, because the "normative bite" comes from our desire to integrate objects in our immediate cognition and agency. When our climbing rope unexpectedly snaps, we feel betrayed because we had integrated that object into our agency and had developed an attitude of not questioning it's integrity.
## Reflection
Towards the end of this paper Nguyen hints at her unquestioning attitude as the potential basis for a new "radically non-individualist epistemology" (37). While probably spitballing a bit more than earlier parts of the paper, I thought that this angle was cool -- certainly Nguyen's account of trust is important for considering trusting relationships to technologies and tools, including uncanny valley, quasi-agential things like AI systems. There are connections to ideas about group agency, distributed cognition, and Clark's Extended Mind hypothesis that seem super worth exploring for their epistemological and even metaphysical import.

I "began" with this paper in the literature review for the thesis, in part because I think it's a great cornerstone for the philosophical discussion on trust that will be relevant to black box systems and explanation as literature concepts / hubs.
