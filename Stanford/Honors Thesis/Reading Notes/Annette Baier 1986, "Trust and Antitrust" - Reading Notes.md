# Summary
Baier's 1986 work on trust seems to be one of the most referenced works in this subject into the present day. In this paper, Annette Baier sets out to distinguish the different forms of trust that may exist and try to formulate a _moral basis_ for trust -- practically speaking, a test to check whether a given instance of trust is moral.

Baier includes a bit of historical context in this paper, noting what she calls a "silence" on the topic of trust within moral philosophy. This is because, in her view, philosophers have been overly concerned with the types of interpersonal relationships best characterized by moral _contract_, that is, equal-footing relationships between autonomous individuals, mostly men. In Baier's view, this fixation causes us to ignore most of the instances where trust is relevant, namely in relationships with imbalanced power structures. She looks particularly at trust in infant-parent relationships, as well as patriarchial husband-wife relationships.

In general, Baier thinks that trust is nearly always present, even in fleeting interpersonal interactions, and we only really notice it when it suddenly goes missing. Baier distinguishes _trust_ from "_mere reliance_" by noting that when trust is lost, we are liable to feel _betrayal_. This is a point visited in depth in [[McLeod 2015, "Trust" - Reading Notes|McLeod's]] treatment of the subject.

Because of this point about betrayal, Baier concludes that trust is something like reliance with an expectation of _goodwill_ (also explored in [[McLeod 2015, "Trust" - Reading Notes|McLeod 2015]] with the term "will-based theories"). Baier sees trust predominantly as a **three-place predicate**, where A trusts B _with_ valued item C, and also predominantly as a relation between two individuals (she points out that this is a limitation of her theory).

Concluding, Baier develops what she calls a "moral test for trust", which she sketches out in (self-admitted) rough terms. A trusting relationship is _moral_ according to Baier if the reasons for assigining trust / trustworthiness survive being made explicit to the trustee / trustor respectively. In other words, an immoral trust relationship would be on perpetuating because of deception on behalf of the trustee, or threat of force by the trustor.
