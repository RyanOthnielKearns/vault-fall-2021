# Summary
This SEP article provides a broad reference for contemporary ethical and policy-related questions around search engines. *Search engine* is here defined as "an information retrieval system that allows for keyword searches of distributed digital text" ([[Halavais 2009]], p. 5-6).

At a glance, ethical issues for search engines might fall into one of these broad categories:
1. Search engine bias and opacity/non-transparency
2. Privacy, monitoring, and surveillance
3. Censorship and democracy
4. Cybersecurity

Search engines are interesting for a constellation of features they have which are unique among other web technologies. One of the main points in the paper that the author routinely revisits is that search engines occupy a privileged place in the architecture of the web, and act as "gatekeepers" of knowledge ([[Hinman, 2005]], p. 21). Without search engines, our access to the web would mean very little, since a complex search utility capable of determining the relevance of various textual data is practically essential for getting anywhere. [[Elgesem 2008]] calls search engines "contributors to the public use of reason" (241).

Given their "gatekeeping" nature, we can think about search engines' effects on things like democracy and freedom of expression, as well as individual autonomy. There are also interesting epistemological questions related to the justification of knowledge claims and how these might be different in a society heavily dependent on search engines.

On the issue of bias, there is disucssion about search engines "personalizing" the results of user queries, and whether this is morally helpful or harmful. For example, [[Goldman (2008)]] sees search engine bias, meaning skewing search results based on user profiles, as a "beneficial consequence," and that it will help us overcome the winner-take-all effect when it comes to search result ordering.

Closely related are issues affecting our privacy, freedom, and autonomy, and there are discussions in this article about informed consent for things like browser cookies, as well as an extended discussion about the [[Right to Erasure]] (RtE) in Europe, related to the [[General Data Protection Regulation]] (GDPR) passed in 2018.

## Discussion on Trust
There is some discussion about trust, though it seems to center mainly on the trust relation between a user and a search engine company (SEC) like Google. Like [[McLeod 2015, "Trust" - Reading Notes|McLeod]], Tavani acknowledges [[Annette Baier 1986, "Trust and Antitrust" - Reading Notes|Baier]]'s 1986 work on trust as seminal for philosophical discussion.

The paper distinguishes between "ethical" and "epistemic" trust. In the former case, we might ask whether an SEC's use of our information is perceieved as transparent or fair. In the latter, we might merely be concerned with the reliability of the information presented via a search engine interface, which is especially interesting when considering things like fake news and echo chamber politics in social media settings.

A great reference that came out of this encyclopedia was [[Walker 2006]], where Margaret Urban Walker explores the notion of "diffuse default trust." This is a flexible enough construal of trust to encompass trust relations between individuals who have never met in person, as well as between people and non-human entities like corporations, bots, and networks of bots. Walker says that trust "links reliance to responsibility." There's also a reference to [[Buechner and Tavani 2011, "Trust and multi-agent systems- applying the 'diffuse, default approach' to experiments involving artificial agents" - Reading Notes]], who further explore Walker's construal in the setting of trust between humans and multi-agent systems.

# Thoughts?
Will I really be using this article heavily in the scope of the honors thesis? Probably not -- search engines are interesting but not the true literary focus of the project. I'm mostly interested in this work just as an example of ethics and epistemology being *vaguely* done in cases where humans and non-human entities, like corporations and algorithms, are involved. There was also the discussion on trust that caught my eye, and this will surely yield some good sources to explore further in the "trusting robots" literature generally.

I still think starting with SEP articles is a good use of my time, though this one may have been less fruitful than the [[McLeod 2015, "Trust" - Reading Notes|McLeod 2015]] article on trust itself... We'll see!
