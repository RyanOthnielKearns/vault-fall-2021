# Summary
Being an SEP article, this piece is a summary / literature review of various philosophical arguments surrounding the central question, **"When is trust warranted?"** Here warranted is intended to include "justified," "well-grounded," and "plausible."

Exploration into this question takes us into three main domains, the first concerning the **nature** of trust (and trustworthiness) itself, the second concerning the **epistemology** of trust, and the third concerning trust's **value**.

## The nature of trust
- First, there is philosophical debate concerning the nature of trust, dating back *sort of* to Baier's 1986 account, [[Annette Baier 1986, "Trust and Antitrust" - Reading Notes|"Trust and Antitrust"]], which sets the first example of a **will-based** account of trust, stating essentially that trust is reliance plus an expectation of goodwill from the trustee. This is one of a family of **[[Motives Based Theories of Trust|motives-based]]** theories, which generally purport that trust differs from reliance and other attitudes by virtue of the trustee possessing the right sort of motivations. Another motives-based account is Russell Hardin's **encapsulated interests** theory, which says that trustworthy peope are motivated by self-interest to maintain their trustworthiness in the eyes of others. In addition, there's a **virtue** account of trustworthiness that paints a picture of a sort of "general" trustworthiness, stating that a person is trustworthy by virtue, i.e. it is baked into their character.

Separate to motives-based theories are **risk-assessment** theories, which liken trust to an assessment of low risk in relying on the trustee, meaning the trustee is assumed willing to do what they're trusted to do. These theories do little to differentiate trust from *mere* reliance (as it's called frequently in the literature) and so are criticized.

Finally, we can theorize that the nature of trust is neither willingness to perform nor a certain motivation. These theories are typically based on a sort of **normative expectation**, wherein the trustor takes a certain *stance* towards the trustee, like Richard Holton's "participant stance." One prominent normative expectation theory is the **trust-responsive** theory, which states that being trustworthy involves having the right sort of response to being trusted to do *X*.

All of these theories have various drawbacks that are discussed in the article, so it's not abundantly clear that philosophers have decided on a most appropriate nature for trust. Many philosophers have accepted a pluralist view on trust for this reason.

## The epistemology of trust
According to McLeod, the central epistemological question at stake here is, "Ought I to trust or not?" This is especially important when trust has potentially damaging ramifications. As such, the question of the **rationality** of trust is particularly central, which raises an issue immediately. Trust and rational reflection seem basically opposed, because fully rationalizing the reasons for trusting someone could be thought equivalent to reducing one's trust down to mere reliance. The author says that trust "inherently involves risk" and this causes the conflict (13).

Sometimes, we need to trust without the ability for rational reflection, as in with emergency room doctors. Other times, we may just bake trust into our daily ongoings, to the extent that rationally reflecting upon *all of it* is impossible.

Two central debates in the epistemology of trust seem to be the **truth-directed** vs. **end-directed** accounts of rationality, and the **internalist** vs. **externalist** accounts of rationality. "End-directed" rationality is a sort of strategic rationality that serves non-epistemic aims, like putting the trustor at ease with the situation. "Internalist" rationality purports that the reasons for trusting need to be justifiable to the trustor themselves, whereas the "externalist" argument suggests that the rationale for trusting depends just on the "epistemic reliability" of its cause, and need not be known to the trustor (15).

This section also spends some time addressing the social and political climate often serving as a backdrop for trust, which we may want to affect the **default stance** people bring to trusting others.

## The value of trust
The value of trust can be intrinsic or instrumental, though most philosophers only care to identify the instrumental values. For one, trust can be helpful for **cooperation**, and even essential to cooperation if Friedrich and Southwood's theory, that trust is essential to **promising**, is true. Philosophers also identify meaningful relationships / attachments, knowledge (scientific, moral, or in general), and autonomy as instrumental values of trust.

# Reflection
I will be coming back to this summary a lot, I think. It made sense to read this SEP article earlier in the process, since it provides me with a really deep reading list with which to continue the dive into trust philosophically, particularly concerning the epistemology / rationality of trust and the values of trust, especially cooperation in a team setting. I'm disappointed a bit that the dominant paradigm for philosophical work on trust is interpersonal trust, because I felt that [[Nguyen 2021, "Trust as an Unquestioning Attitude" - Reading Notes|Nguyen's work]] on a more general form for trust was illuminating. Whatever. There is some literature referenced both here and in [[Nguyen 2021, "Trust as an Unquestioning Attitude" - Reading Notes|Nguyen 2021]] on trust in non-interpersonal settings, which I'm hoping to grapple with as I think about how to apply this philosophical history to the problem of trusting black boxes.
