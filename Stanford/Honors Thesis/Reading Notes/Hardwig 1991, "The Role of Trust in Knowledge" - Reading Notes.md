# Summary
Hardwig's 1991 paper seeks to challenge a conventional notion in epistemology that "knowledge rests of evidence, not trust" (693). Instead, Hardwig asserts that as modern knowledge acquisition increasingly comes to rely on teamwork and cooperation, it is our _trust_ in others, and not our independent evidence, that serves as the foundation for our knowledge.

This is an uncomfortable account because, according to Hardwig, trust is "blind" (693). Yet in many settings it is the only way to acquire knowledge, particularly in modern science. Hardwig references a paper measuring the lifespan of charm particles, which took 280 person-years of work to complete. No individual human would be capable of coming to the experiment's conclusions on their own, and so with the conventional epistemological account it would be difficult to say that anyone *knows* the lifespan of charm particles. But this is uncomfortable, as we want the charm particle experiment to count as useful science. So, according to Hardwig, we need to grant the *team itself* sufficient evidence to justify the conclusion about charm particle lifespan, even though no individual team member may possess this evidence.

Hardwig states that trust factors into the origins of someone's knowledge, as well as the "context of justification" i.e. justifying that knowledge (696). Digging a bit more into trust, Hardwig develops what he calls the **principle of testimony**:
> If $A$ has good reasons to believe that $B$ has good reasons to believe $p$, then $A$ has good reasons to believe $p$.

We may also replace "has good reasons to believe" here with "knows" for a stronger version of the principle.

As a way towards trust, Hardwig analyzes the problem of coming to a belief through testimony or testimonial evidence. Sometimes, so claims Hardwig, the best reasons for justifying a belief will be testimonial, as in the case with charm particles, simply because good reasons resting on direct, nontestimonial evidence would be impossible to obtain. Hardwig again refers to the "blindness" of this kind of knowledge: the reasons for justifying $p$ (and $A$'s belief that $p$) are reasons that $A$ does not have (699).

At this point, Hardwig is faced with a decision among three possible accounts:
1. There can no longer be knowledge in a lot of scientific communities relying on cooperation;
2. One can know $p$ without having access to some of the best evidence for $p$;
3. Some knowledge is *actually* known by teams and not individual people on those teams.

Hardwig decides to argue for a version of 2, which is that $A$ can *know* $p$ without direct access to the best evidence, which requires a modification to our account of rational belief (699).

Following this exploration into belief obtained via testimony, Hardwig moves to investigating the properties of $A$'s relationship to $B$ that might imply "good reasons" to believe $B$'s account that $p$ (700). These qualities of $B$ are, in short:
1. **truthful**: $B$ is being honest
2. **competent**: $B$ knows what constitute good reasons to believe in this domain
3. **conscientious**: $B$ has done their work carefully
4. **adequate epistemic self-assessment**: $B$ must not be misled about the limits of their own knowledge in the subject matter pertaining to $p$

So, $A$ makes an assessment of $B$'s character, both **moral** (truthfulness) and **epistemic** (competence, conscientiousness, adequate self-assessment) character. So, **$A$ must trust $B$** insofar as they are relying on $B$ and expecting a responsive form of goodwill or virtue from $B$ to cement that trust. In this way I might think that Hardwig's account, though largely concerning trust in an epistemic setting, aligns with [[Annette Baier 1986, "Trust and Antitrust" - Reading Notes|Baier]]'s family of will-based accounts of trust (discussed in [[McLeod 2015, "Trust" - Reading Notes|McLeod 2015]]). *If $A$ doesn't trust $B$*, then $B$'s testimony about $p$ will not give $A$ good reasons to believe $p$.
