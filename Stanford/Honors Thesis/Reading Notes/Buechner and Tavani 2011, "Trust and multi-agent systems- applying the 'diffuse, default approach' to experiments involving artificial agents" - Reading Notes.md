- using experiments about trust in multi-agent systems (models for trust) as motivation for a more precise nature of trust in literature
	- ethicists should make use of the data
- particular model of trust advocated has 4 conditions (the formalization of $c$ is absent from the authors' definition as they define as only a 2-place relation):
	1. $A$ has a *normative expectation* that $B$ will do $c$
	2. $B$ is responsible for $c$
	3. $A$ is disposed to normatively expect that $B$ will responsibly do $c$
	4. $A$'s normative expectation from 1. can be mistaken
- following these 4 conditions $A$ is "disposed to trust" $B$ (41).
- the normative features of the above definition make it hard to appy to relationships between humans and non-human entities (animals, algorithms, governments)
- another view: artificial agents (AAs) are "part of the environment" and people come into trusting relationships with that environment
	- follows Margaret Urban Walker, who talks about places one feels safe as default zones of trust -- "default" trust is assumed in such environments under certain circumstances
	- in cities: we rely on large communities of strangers to follow certain rules like traffic laws and ordinances about how to dispose garbage -- even for people not to bump into you while walking, which isn't legally enforced
	- Walker's categorical example for "diffuse, default trust" is feeling resentment at an airline for poor service -- this is not so simple as resentment towards all the people working for the airline -- the datum of "I trusted that airline and they let me down" needs to be accounted for in our notion
		- not just a group of individuals but a complex entity that organizes in a particular way
- connection between *committment* and *trust*, shown according to the authors in SPIRE (Shared Plans Intention Reconciliation Experiments)
