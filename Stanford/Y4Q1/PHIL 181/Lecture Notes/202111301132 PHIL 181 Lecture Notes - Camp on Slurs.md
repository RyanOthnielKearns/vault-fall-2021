___
Finishing up the class with some specific linguistic phenomena (in natural language)
- "applied philosophy of language"
- how far have we gotten?
- trying to assess ways of corralling / explaining via truth conditions, reference, predication, implicature, presupposition
	- two salient impressions:
		1. something to be optimistic about re: general enterprise in the mess of human cognition --> theoretically tractable phenomena
		2. foundations are still a mess -- looking at interesting phenomena like slurs / dogwhistles makes this clear
			- what would it take to explain these phenomena (case studies)? --> the attempt to do so shows foundations not terribly secure; should refine distinctions etc.

# Camp on Slurs
## What are slurs? How do they function?
- Camp "mentions" slurs (use-mention distinction from Quine)
	- even *mentioning* = "bringing them to mind" -- which is problematic!
		- should be an adequate compensation in *insight* from the discussion (Camp)
- what's distinctive about slur terms?
	- use of slurs also has *neutral correlate* (the group term)
	- the *group term* and the *slur term* are extensionally equivalent -- supposed to apply to the same group of people
		- but argument: the slur term should not apply "truly" to anybody, including members of the group
- the approach: ask how terms in the category function, and use that account to define the kind -- *rather than* defining the category first, then asking how terms in the category function
	- Putnam's *natural kind* terms were defined in this way
