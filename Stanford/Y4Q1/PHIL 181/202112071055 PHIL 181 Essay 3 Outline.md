___
*Prompt*: Putting aside the question whether Grice's account in "Meaning" is a successful analysis of an ordinary concept (of a speaker "meaning" something in a certain familiar sense), is he right in his claim that the technical concept he develops (of intending to produce a belief by reason of the recognition of that intention) has a fundamental explanatory role to play in theories about meaning and communication?
___
Argument outline:
- No
- To reject that Grice's concept is *fundamentally explanatory* in theories about meaning / communication --> identify aspects of meaning / communication in which Grice's concept is a poor explanatory model
- Specifically, we'll focus on communication, and draw up examples of communication where reasoning via the recognition of an intention doesn't seem necessary
- These examples force us to conclude that Grice's account of meaning is *not* fundamentally explanatory. Gricean accounts are subsumed under more fundamental theories of explanations, having to do with the ultimate or distal functions of a communicative act.
- Gricean intentions are a proximate means to the end of triggering the desired effects of communication, *but there are other means*, which makes Gricean intentions *not fundamental* to communication

# Outline
## Introduction
In "Meaning," H.P. Grice provides an account of meaning that is grounded in rational, intentional communicative behavior between speaker and audience. This account does not, however, play a foundational explanatory role in theories of meaning and communication. To show why, we can identify distal goals of communication that subsume Grice's proximate goals for speaker occasion meaning, and provide examples of communication that occur without the intentionality required for Gricean meaning. If genuine examples of communication reside outside of Grice's scope, then Grice has not provided us with a foundational explanatory piece of communication. Rather, Grice's account is at best foundational for explaining a subspecies of communication.

## Grice's account in "Meaning"
### Defining Grice's target
In "Meaning," Grice begins by distinguishing between natural and non-natural meaning. In cases like "Those spots meant measles," the sense of "mean" is the natural sense. Here, the aforementioned spots *entail* measles. Further, from "Those spots meant measles" we cannot argue that anybody meant anything by those spots. Also note that "Those spots meant measles" cannot become "Those spots meant 'measles.'"

A case of non-natural meaning would be something like "Those three rings on the bell mean that the bus is full." Now, note that all of the conditions above are reversed. First, three rings on the bell do not entail that the bus is full. The conductor could have made a mistake, or prompted a child to ring the bell for fun, etc. Also, somebody (the conductor) certainly meant or should have meant something by those three rings on the bell. Finally, we can restate "Those three rings on the bell mean that the bus is full" as "Those three rings on the bell mean that 'the bus is full.'"

We can understand the conductor as taking a *communicative action* in ringing the bell -- she *means* that the bus is full when he does so. This particular form, where an agent means something by performing an action, is a species of non-natural meaning that Grice calls *speaker occasion meaning*. Thus, speaker occasion meaning is central to the nature of communicative action, and Grice takes an account of this phenomenon as a target of his paper.

### Intermediate attempts to characterize speaker occasion meaning
In the next part of the paper, Grice iterates through several proposals for what constitutes speaker occasion meaning. First, Grice proposes a rather naive definition:
> $A$ meant something or other by utterance $U$ iff $A$ intended $U$ to cause an audience to believe something.

This definition appears to work for the bus conductor example: by ringing the bell, she intended her bell ringing to cause an audience (her passengers) to believe that 'the bus is full.' Yet this attempt runs into some counterexamples. Consider fiddling with your phone on the subway to make peope think you are busy. Clearly you intend your phone fiddling to cause your fellow subway riders to think 'that person is busy.' But you definitely do not mean that you are busy! Thus, subway phone fiddling is a counterexample to the *sufficiency* of this definition. There is something to speaker occasion meaning that is not just about getting a belief across.

Grice thinks that what is missing is this: in cases of real speaker occasion meaning, the audience knows that the speaker is intending to get some belief across. He formulates his second attempted definition:
> $A$ meant something or other by utterance $U$ iff $A$ intended $U$ to:
> 1. cause an audience to believe something, and
> 2. recognize that they are so intended.

Once again, our example with the bus conductor fits, because the bus occupants recognize that the conductor intends them to believe 'the bus is full.' Our revised definition also explains why subway phone fiddling is *not* a case of speaker occasion meaning. Your phone fiddling is intended to convince an audience that 'they are busy,' but the audience does not know that you are intending to get this belief across.

However, we run into counterexamples once again. Consider the case where Herod presents Salome with John the Baptist's head. Herod performs this action intending it to cause Salome to believe 'John the Baptist is dead.' Moreover, Salome recognizes this as Herod's intention. Yet Herod's intention to produce this belief has nothing to do with his say-so, informedness, or well-intentions on the matter. So, we ought not to consider this a case of speaker occasion meaning, and therefore have a second counterexample to sufficiency.

This counterexample, and ones like it, prompt Grice to deliver his final proposal for speaker occasion meaning:
> $A$ meant something or other by utterance $U$ iff $A$ intended $U$ to:
> 1. cause an audience to believe something, and
> 2. recognize that they are so intended, and
> 3. include this recognition in their reasoning as to whether the intended belief is true.

This proposed definition saves us from the counterexample with John the Baptist's head. In presenting the head, Herod fails to *mean* that John the Baptist is dead, in the speaker occasion sense, because of clause 3. Salome does not need to recognize Herod's intention in deciding whether John the Baptist is dead, because he is merely being shown evidence that confirms it. Suppose instead that Salome had instructed Herod to bang a ceremonial gong to commemorate John's demise. In banging the gong, Herod actually *does* mean John the Baptist is dead, because Salome must now rely on Herod's intentions in deciding whether this fact is true. Herod barging in and announcing "I have killed John the Baptist!" also clearly does the job.

### Grice's final attempt
With his final proposal, Grice accounts for (speaker occasion) meaning as a species of *intending* -- specifically, intending in the reflexive fashion characterized by the definition. So, according to Grice, communicative action is a type of intentional behavior where speakers aim to implant beliefs in their audiences via the audience's own judgements. When the conductor rings the bell, a pedestrian says, "I think that her plan in ringing the bell was to get me to believe that the bus is full." Likewise, after banging his ceremonial gong, Herod says "Now I think that Salome thinks that I believe John the Baptist is dead."

Daniel Dennett calls this definition "third-order" in the sense that speakers require third-order beliefs like "I think that she thinks that I think" in order to mean anything^[Dennett 1987, *The Intentional Stance*].

## An argument against Grice's account as fundamentally explanatory
The prompt asks us to consider whether Grice's account of speaker meaning "has a fundamental explanatory role to play in theories about meaning and communication." To show that Grice's account does *not* play such a fundamental role, it would suffice to show any example of genuine meaning or communication where Grice's account does not apply. Should we do so, then we show that Grice's conditions for speaker meaning are not necessary for all cases of meaning or communication. Then, the onus is on Gricean advocates to explain how their conditions are "fundamentally explanatory" without being necessary.

### Counterexample: the waggle dance
To find such an example, we can look at communicative acts in the animal kingdom. Consider the honeybee. Worker honeybees perform an elaborate movement called a "waggle dance" to indicate the location of resources like nectar^[Riley et al. 2005, "The flight paths of honeybees recruited by the waggle dance"]. The axis of the honeybee's dance, with respect to the line between the hive and the sun, indicates the axis from that line along which the nectar is located^[Millikan, "Truth, Hoverflies, ..."]. The duration of the "waggle" part of the dance indicates the distance from the hive. Thus, each different waggle dance corresponds to a polar coordinate that other honeybees can use to find their way to the nectar.

Although we've used "indicates" here, it is apt to describe the waggle dance as *communicating* the location of the nectar to other honeybees. Why? Other honeybees have not been to the nectar themselves, so their ability to locate it is dependent entirely upon the message encoded within the waggle. In this way, the waggle dance is designed to impart information to other bees who do not know the location, without them acquiring this evidence of their own accord. Anyone, beekeeper or otherwise, would be hard pressed to reject this behavior as communicative.

### Accomodating the waggle dance under Grice's account
Let us now suppose that Grice's account *is* fundamental to a theory of communication and meaning that explains the honeybee dance. What must be the case? We have established that the waggle dance counts as a genuine communicative act. Moreover, it feels natural for an ethologist to say, on some particular occasion, "That waggle dance *means* that some nectar is located at such-and-such location from the hive."

If we would like to count the dance as a case of meaning, we have two choices, and neither is satisfactory. First, the waggle dance cannot count as a case of *natural* meaning, because a bee performing the dance does not entail that the honey is genuinely located where the bee indicated. This particular honeybee might have a stump leg, resulting in an off-kilter dance, or the "sun" could be a lamp set up by some scientists interested in honeybee behavior, etcetera. The key here is that honeybees can *fail* to mean the correct location of the nectar when they do their dance, which cannot occur in cases of natural meaning.

Second, the waggle dance cannot count as speaker occasion meaning either. For a waggle dance to count as speaker occasion meaning, we would require that honeybees reason about the veracity of beliefs by recognizing the intentions of other honeybees. In other words, we need a theory of mind for honeybees. Most biologists, and philosophers, would find this ridiculous.

So our alternatives are that the honeybee waggle dance is either a case of non-natural meaning other than speaker occasion meaning, or not meaning at all. Yet the waggle dance *is* a communicative act of some interest, and ought to be explained by any foundational theory of meaning and communication. Thus, we must conclude that Grice's account is, at best, explanatory in a non-fundamental way to theories of meaning and communication.

## A Gricean reply to the argument
### An objection to the argument
An advocate of Grice's theory might reply that we actually *have* pointed out something fundamental in bringing up Grice in the honeybee example. Honeybee waggle dancing is certainly not a case of speaker occasion meaning, but the reasons *why* are best explained by Gricean conditions.

When someone says, "By dancing, the honeybee *meant* that the nectar is at such-and-such location," their use of "meant" in the speaker occasion sense is illusory. What they are doing is putting themself in the place of the honeybee. They may think: if I were a honeybee, how would I learn where the nectar is? Well, I would watch my fellow honeybee dance. In dancing, this honeybee desires that I believe the nectar is at such-and-such location -- and to do so by recognition of the fact that they are intending me to believe it! So, this honeybee clearly *means* that the nectar is at such-and-such location.

The reason we believe speaker occasion meaning is at work is that we've tricked ourselves into attributing theory of mind to honeybees. Honeybees do not have minds capable of complex belief states. They certainly don't have the "third-order" belief states that Dennett takes as required for Gricean meaning. By denying honeybees from speaker-occasion-meaning anything, we reaffirm that this kind of meaning depends on intentions, beliefs, and theory of mind in a non-trivial way. We understand more what makes speaker occasion meaning a complex phenomenon worth investigating. Thus, Grice's conditions are explanatory even when they reject certain communicative acts as (speaker occasion) meaningful.

### A reply to the objection
While this objection is valid, it weakens the idea that Grice's account in "Meaning" targets the *nature of communicative action*, as discussed in section 2.1. Lots of animals, including young humans, undertake communicative actions without a theory of mind to back them. Under Grice's account, these actions are not meaningful. So, as more examples of non-meaningful communicative action pile up, it becomes difficult to entertain speaker occasion meaning as *central* to communicative action.

We also must contend with an awkward gray area in the case of young humans and their communicative acts. According to psychology, we develop the capacity for belief attribution in a gradual way. Thus, our capacity to *mean* in the Gricean sense would also develop gradually -- which seems odd. Surely acts are either meaningful or not; so when do we commit our first "meaningful" action?
