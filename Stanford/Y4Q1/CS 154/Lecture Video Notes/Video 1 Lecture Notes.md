- Definition about computation: "to find out (something) by using a mathematical process"
	- Left out of definition: _computers_!
	- Want a definition that is stable throughout technological progress
	- Notion of computers actually predates digital computers -- used to be a profession
- Algorithms we have spent time learning (not just in digital computers)
	- E.g. grade school multiplication
	- Algebra -- born in computation
	- Geometry -- has its roots in algorithms
		- "You cannot square a circle" = computational impossibility result
- **Computing**: the "evolution of an environment via repeated application of *simple*, *local* rules"
	- What is this environment we are changing?
	- What are the simple, local rules we apply in this environment?
	- ==> The Computational Lens
- Computational Bounding (Limited Resources)
	- Zero Knowledge Proofs: convince you of a statement w/o learning anything more about the statement (any details)
- Randomness: adds computational power
	- Entropy
	- pseudorandomness: way for randomness to increase on its own
- Theory of Computation brings significant power to: game theory, comp. complexity, pseudorandomness, etc etc.
