# Question 1
## 1.2
- Focus on just two different types of nodes, like do a star graph for one graph so that all nodes update identically
## 1.3
- The hard one
- Can assume all features are identical when initialized, e.g. all scalar 1's
- can assume no collisions
- return is the final multisets of the labels
	- as a set, no ordering
- trying to prove: if the readout sets, e.g. the GCN output, are different, then the WL test will also decide that the graphs are not isomorphic
	- The inverse is not true, e.g. the readouts being equal does not tell you that the graphs are isomorphic (the WL test cannot definitively prove isomorphisms)
- Technically a proof of the contrapositive
	- WL no conclusion -> readouts are the same
		- if the features learned by the GCN are the same, the `readout` output of those feature sets will be the same
- `combine` and `aggregate` do the same as the hash function in WL, but they might be a little weaker, since the GCN might be less good at determining isomorphism than WL

# Question 2
Vectors $h$, $l$, $t$ are embeddings
- TransE tries to ensure that $\mathbf{h}+l\approx\mathbf{t}$
	- Try to ensure this relationship in the embedding space if the edge does exist, and make sure relationship does not exist if the edge is not in the graph
- Corrupted set $S'$: equal to triples $(h, l, t)$ where one of $h$ or $t$ is an entity, and you replace either $h$ or $t$ randomly with something different -- with high probability one of the "corrupted" triples is not an edge
