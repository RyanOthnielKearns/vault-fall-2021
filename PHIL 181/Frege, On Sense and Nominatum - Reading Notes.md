For [[Frege On Sense and Nominatum.pdf]]
- three layers of differences between words / expressions:
	1. the imagery (most personal) ==> one' retinal image of the moon in a telescope lens
		- only really brought up to ensure that we don't mistake the *sense* for this thing that is actually the image / picturization
	2. the sense ==> the moon's projection into a telescope
	3. the nominatum ==> the moon
- pp. 190: "the nominatum of a sentence is its truth value"

==Stopped on top of pp. 191==
