# Contributions
- together with Peter Strawson, wrote "In Defense of a Dogma" to counter Quine's "Two Dogmas of Empiricism"
- disagrees with the "meaning is use" doctrine (from Wittgenstein, others)
	- distinction between meaning and use has applications in philosophy, linguistics, AI
		- analytic/synthetic distinction -- requires truth by virtue of meaning
		- idea of a "**conversational implicature**" -- requires a full philosophical theory of meaning

## 1957: "Meaning"
Two notions of meaning:
1. What sentence means *in general* (apart from any use)
2. What a specific speaker means by using the sentence on a particular occasion
	- what the speaker intends

## "Defending a Dogma"
- Quine's rejection of the analytic/synthetic distinction: to make it out to be an illusion
- two distinctions contra Quine:
	1. distinguish between an utterance meaning something vs. not meaning anything
	2. revising belief by either (a) recognizing a previous belief as false or (b) involving a change in concept / in the meaning of a word

# Conversational implicature
- things to work out based on the *way* something was said rather than *what* was said
## 4 categories
1. **Quantity**: make contribution as informative as required, but no more informative than required
2. **Quality**: make contribution one that is true
3. **Relation**: "be relevant"
4. **Manner**: "be perspicuous"

... I think I read about this in PSYCH 1???

## The material conditional
are truth conditions of declarative conditional statements accurately captured by the material conditional?
- conditional $A\rightarrow B$ only appropriate when speaker does not know truth values of $A$ and $B$ but has some reason to believe the conditional
	- otherwise, conversational maxims (above) make it inappropriate

# Meaning
- *M-intention*: $U$ means that $p$ by uttering $x$ $\leftrightarrow$ $U$ M-intends that $p$ by uttering $x$
	- utterer intends audience to understand something / perform an action
- *indicative* vs. *imperative* moods in utterances (**mood operators**)
	- *indicative*$(p)$ -- intending audience to think that you (the utterer) think $p$ ("The door is closed")
	- *imperative*$(p)$ -- intending audience to *intend* that $p$ ("Close the door!")
> We can see communication as a rational activity in which an utterer intends to produce certain results and audiences reason their way to those results via their recognition of the uttererâ€™s intention to produce that very result.

- *resultant procedures*: syntactic structures of sentences divide into mood operator + rest of the sentence (which is "moodless")
	1. Uttering $*+\mathbf{R}$ if, for some $A$, $u$ wants $A$ to $\psi$ that $p$;
	2. Uttering $*+\mathbf{R}$ if, for some $A$, $u$ wants $A$ to think $U$ to $\psi$ that $p$;
	-	where $\psi$ is the psychological state or action associated with $*$ (which functionally maps psychological states to mood operators, i.e. indicative or imperative (or other))

- satisfactory?
	- what about knowledge of the semantic properties of words / combinations of words?
		- possible that these cannot be fully analyzed in terms of speakers' intentions (though never addressed by Grice)
