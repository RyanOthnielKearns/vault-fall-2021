# Reading Notes for [[Carnap 1956, "Empiricism, Semantics, and Ontology".pdf]]
## Notes
- seems like the thread of correspondence between language and world continues to show up in Carnap from Frege and Russell's original concerns
	- the "acceptance of the thing language" ==> "acceptance of the thing world"
		- but crucially, according to Carnap, not accepting a *belief* in the things the thing language is talking about (or the reality of the thing world), just the formalisms of the language
		- questions posed in the language can be *internal to the system*, meaning about facts derivable from the rules and conventions of hte language (6)
- "Are there numbers?" is either posed internal to the framework of mathematics (and then is trivially analytically true) or prior to the framework of mathematics (which, according to Carnap, makes no sense unless posed properly in scientific language, so it's a "pseudo-question")
	- Another kind of external question: one about practicality: "Are our experiences such that the use of the linguistic forms in question will be expedient and fruitful?" (11)
		- This relates to how Carnap might answer Frege, Russell, and Meinong regarding the problem of designation / correspondence: "Thus the question of the admissibility of entities of a certain type or of abstract entities in general as designata is reduced to the question of the acceptability of the linguistic framework for those entities" (16)
			- It's a practical matter! Or it's nonsensical
	- No evidence could surface that could possibly sway one camp over to the other
- Carnap: propositions like "extra-systematic" explanations of how language functions, the way one explains elementary physics using models (9)
- Carnap's proposal to philosophers of language is to be tolerant in permitting the use of various linguistic forms, saying that the people using them know what they're doing, and improper forms will be invalidated by virtue of their impracticality

## Reaction
In "Empiricism, Semantics, and Ontology," Carnap's overarching proposal to philosophers of language is to be tolerant in permitting the use of various linguistic forms, and to evaluate linguistic forms on the basis of their practicality and expedience of use *within* a particular scientific community. Carnap talks about one "accepting the thing language," i.e. accepting the linguistic conventions used to talk about everyday objects and events, and to assert propositions about those things. He says such acceptance necessitates "acceptance of the thing *world*," though crucially, not a *belief* in the things the thing language is talking about -- that is, not the thing world's *reality*. In this way, accepting the thing world basically just means accepting the conventions and nomenclature we've decided on for conceptualizing it.

This formulation leads to a convenient yet (to me, somehow) frustrating conclusion about questions like "Are there numbers?" Carnap says this must be thought about (1) as a question posed internally to the framework of mathematics, making its answer trivially true or (2) a question posed prior to the acceptance of the mathematical framework, in which case there's no clear empirical route that might decide the answer. So, Carnap thinks "Are there numbers?" either has a trivially true answer within the system or is else meaningless, or non-cognitive. This frustrates me as it feels like we've lost the ability to ask what is genuinely a metaphysically important question, though Carnap's tight practicality constraints on language are at the same time quite tidy. I do worry about how this conception of, say, mathematical language maps onto reality in cases of true universals like "There are infinitely many prime numbers."
