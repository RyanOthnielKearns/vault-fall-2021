# Second Reading Reaction for Kripke's [[Saul Kripke, "Naming and Necessity" (excerpts).pdf|"Naming and Necessity"]]
## PHIL 181

Try also to get very clear about Kripke’s explanation of the distinction between necessity/possibility and a priority/a posteriority, and also about the role played in Kripke’s conception of language by the notion of a sentence _being true considered as describing a certain possible world_.

---

Upon a second reread, I'm struck by how central Kripke's modal understanding of metaphysics is to his conception of language, and by extension his opinions for a proper account of definite descriptions. A central problem for Kripke to solve is _trans-world identity_. When I say "Aristotle was a philosopher," I know it to be true of the actual world. How do I know that I'm referring to the same entity as, say, Aristotle in the counterfactual world where he became a plumber? The idea that such a persistent reference must exist seems a central requirement to Kripke. This is actually a large piece of his problem with the cluster of descriptions view -- namely, the view _fails_ to satisfy trans-world identity since each description seems only contingently true of the referent. It seems odd, by this account, that we'd consider the meanings of "Aristotle" and "the satisfier of a weighted most of _C_" to be necessarily identical, since Aristotle's satisfying of each description in _C_ (like being a philosopher) could have been otherwise. This is why Kripke's proposal for an account of definite descriptions considers them as _rigid designators_ first and foremost, picking out the same object across all possible worlds.
