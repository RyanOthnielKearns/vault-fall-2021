# Reading Reaction to Millikan's [[Millikan Language Conventions Made Simple.pdf|"Language Conventions Made Simple"]]

Millikan says that natural conventions are merely patterns of behavior that (1) are reproduced, and (2) are used in virtue of their precedent. In other words, a pattern of behavior that is reproduced because it is used, and used because it was reproduced, is a convention. This is, of course, not the most charitable reading of Millikan's analysis, but I think it gets at the intuitive issue I took on while reading the paper. Millikan's conventions are self-fulfilling and therefore arbitrary patterns, and this arbitrariness makes them very simplistic explanations for speech acts. I think what Millikan gains in simplicity she loses in explication or correspondence, if we are to compare her account to Grice's account. Millikan's conventions present a clean and untangled categorization of speech acts, but they do not strike at the complexities of how language maps to the world or allows us to reason about the world in powerful ways. To use her own language, I think that some elements of natural language (grammatical forms, quantification, etc.) are more like running a jar under hot water to open it than using red and green lights for Christmas -- they have a metaphysically loaded preference and are not best described as arbitrarily "conventional" behavior.
