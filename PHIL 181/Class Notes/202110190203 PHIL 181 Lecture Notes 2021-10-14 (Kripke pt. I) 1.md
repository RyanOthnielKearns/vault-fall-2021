# Kripke
## Contributions to logic
- huge effect on metaphysics / epistemology / philosophy of language
- 1950s: debate regarding use of the modal $\diamond, \square$ symbols in logic
	- Kripkean "semantics": the $\square$ is a "quantifier over possibilities" -- ranigng over items / possible worlds / ways things might be
	- semantic or "model theoretic" way of explaining: give semantic account of $\top, \bot$ and use truth tables
		- to be contrasted with "proof theoretic view"
		- do all arguments made by each of these views *agree*? (the point of soundness & completeness results in logic is to assert this)
	- Kripke provided systematic, set-theoretic account of how $\top, \bot$ are sensitive to our usage of $\diamond, \square$ (*model-theoretic* account)

## Analytic / A Priori / Necessary
- positivists / empiricists basically conflated all three of these
	- Kripke disagrees with this view: there are empirical necessities, and a priori contingencies

### Necessary vs. contingent *facts*
- metaphysics
- ways the world must be vs. could have not been
- essence vs. accidents -- Kripke "proudly waving the Aristotelean essentialist flag" here

### A priori vs. a posteriori
- epistemological
- do we need to trust our senses to justify our belief in $X$?
- a priori doesn't mean *must* be known independently of experience, but it *can* be

## Reviving Frege / Russell's proper names accounts
how to "revive" Frege / Russell's common-sense direction w.r.t. proper names
- contribution: making it fine to be common-sensical again
	- w/ positivists and Quine: talk is "fine" -- to say things exist -- sure! But what do people *mean* when they say things like that?
		- only relevant so far as our *ends* are concerned
		- "*useful* figments" for predicting experiences (and nothing more, according to Quine)
			- a very different hypothesis that might be tempting: they could also be useful because they're *real*
				- positivists will say this hypothesis is equivalent in terms of utility
	- Kripke wants to return to the conceptual / linguistic intercourse w/ reality that made Frege and Russell's theories intuitively appealing

### Worries w/ Frege / Russell's descriptional accounts
- Frege footnote 2: descriptive accounts that different speakers associate with a name will differ
	- Wittgenstein: any one description seems dispensable
- Not hard to come up with counterexamples

### "Cluster of Descriptions" Theory
- each description is like 1 leg of a table -- is it essential? Just take it out and see if the table stays standing...

#### Reference Fixation
- reference of the name is that unique thing (if anything) that the "weighted most" of the cluster denotes
#### Semantic Function
- *meaning* of a name *is* cluster of descriptions $C$
- "If $NN$ exists, $NN$ satisfies a weighted most of $C$" is:
	- a priori
	- necessary (a way the world cannot help but be)
		- Kripke focuses on attacking this: makes a modal objection
			- "If Aristotle existed, Aristotle was a philosopher" -- true but *contingent*
				- "being a philosopher" is an accidental property of Aristotle (maybe essential in the *colloquial* sense but not in the *philosophical* sense)
				- "trans-world identity" problem for Kripke -- how is *this* Aristotle "the same guy" as the one in that counterfactual world who instead became a plumber instead of a philosopher?
				- if descriptions in $C$ are of this sort (i.e. well-known features and doings), it's *contingent* that Aristotle satisfied a weighted most of $C$
				- it just seems wrong that the meanings of "Aristotle" and "the satisfier of the weighted most of $C$" are necessarily identical
			- "True" means true according to the actual world
				- meanings of the sentences determines their truth / falsity about *all* worlds (not just actual! that was old news, from Kripke's perspective)
					- Kripke "discovered the relativity of truth and falsity"
					- proper names are "constrained by our conventions" to pick out the same (trans-world identical) entity
