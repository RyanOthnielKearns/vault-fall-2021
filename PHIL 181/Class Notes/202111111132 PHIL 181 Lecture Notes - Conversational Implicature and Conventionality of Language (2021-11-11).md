- not quite right to paint Grice as a metaphysician, but this is nonetheless what he's capturing
	- linguistic communication is a phenomenon we'd like to understand
	- Grice: this is a category of something more general, which is just *rational agency* (agents acting in a rational manner)
		- reductive at heart
		- for success: hearer is going to be relying on the speaker's rational attitude in communicating to get the point across -- rational communication
- still key to this day: **David Lewis's account of convention**
	- very similar to Grice -- explain conventionality generally in terms of rationality / rational agency (a *game-theoretic* story of how linguistic communincation works -- conventions yield "winning strategies" to maximize utility in communication)
	- right way to read Millikan: resisting this reductive strategy
		- Grice's account of speaker-meaning is over-intellectualized
			- Millikan is on this side, but just as reductive as Grice / Lewis -- only a proponent of the *other main reductive strategy* at the time: **naturalism**
				- emergence of language *among organisms* -- naturally unexceptional
				- meaning gets to have a place in nature in our particular hardware
		- *how does meaning arise naturally among organisms?*
			- reduce weird meaning / communicative / linguistic phenomena to more naturalistic phenomena
				- in-principle question: "how is (goodness, meaning, etc.) *out there*?"... among quarks, photons, ...
				- there are hardwire signals that nature insists upon, but also room for "improvised" kinds of signalling
				- don't lean on the heavyweight accounts of rationality when describing speaker-meaning if you don't have to!
			- rules of language are *normative* rather than *descriptive*
				- when you say what the truth conditions are in a given language, it's a consequence of what speakers of the language *ought to do* with their use of the language

# The epistemology of conversational implicature
- Grice: conversational implicature "deduced" or "calculated" based on what's literally said + maxims
	- --> what is "speaker-meant"
	- like there's some algorithmic story about getting from evidence to conclusion
	- what kinds of deductions are these?
		- is it too strong to say that 'supposition that speaker thinks that $q$' is *required* to explain how speaker is cooperative?
			- infinite # of propositions that would be perfectly cooperative in a given setting... not just one to get across! how does hearer determine *which* of those propositions the speaker is trying to get across?
				- disambiguation *generally* - a kind of "mind-reading"
			- does Grice *overemphasize the rationality of communication*? Might a better explanation have to do with *skills* and *habits* (experience) with the language that gives you hints about what the speaker might mean here?
				- speakers and hearers "on the same page" about that kind of implicature
				- maybe not modeled best by deductive reasoning
				- negative condition: "the speaker hasn't prevented me from concluding that this must be what's implied... this must be what's implied"
					- a kind of "aha!" moment where the hearer determines the *only* thing the speaker could have meant by what they made as if to say
- conversational implicature is the *most* flexible form of language use
	- speaker has just made as if to say that $p$ and is counting on hearer to understand $q$

## Irony & Metaphor
- do Grice's accounts of irony / metaphor paint them (implausibly) as techniques for meaning things without relyong on historical / conventional knowledge?
	- irony / metaphor change the meaning of sentences but don't change the definitions of words in the dictionary...
		- *crucial to communication*, but doesn't get *lexicalized*
		- *lexicalization*: conventionality! standardization of tools for speaker-meaning
			- but there can be standardization / conventionality in understanding via precedent (as with irony / metaphor)
	- e.g. exploitable in communication: no one is using the word "fabulous" with it's literal meaning! so you can rely on it as a sarcastic device. but that doesn't append a new dictionary definition to the word "fabulous"
		- Grice takes a sort of lexically-forced account of conventional implicatures, which doesn't seem to fit perfectly well here
		- these arise with high frequency, to do w/ literal meanings and the maxims:
			- "he did this and did that" (and in that order)
			- "$p$ or $q$" (and I don't know which) -- if I knew $p$, I'd just say "$p$", right? otherwise the performance *doesn't make sense* to the hearer

## Tests for conversational implicature
- **Cancelability** (Grice)
	- Should be able to say "$p$ *but I don't mean to imply* $q$!" Not self-contradictory
		- If it's *just* an implicature, you should be able to sort of "manually" cancel the implicature in your utterance
	- what the conversational implicativist calls cancellability the ambiguity theorist says "disambiguation"
	- in general of dubious value... you can add material to affect how you're getting across this thing $q$, but this doesn't make clear how $q$ relates to what was said when this extra material is omitted (???)
- **Non-detachability** (Grice)
- **Calculability** (Grice)
- Fragility under embeddings
	- e.g. with irony: "You're a fine friend" implies that you're not, but the negation ("You're not a fine friend") can't really be bent to mean that you are (the negation of the implication from earlier)
		- Compare with "I haven't had lunch yet" -- negation also implies the negation of what was first implied (because this isn't conversational implicature)
	- no reason to think that "not $p$" implicates "not $q$"

# Conventionality of Language
- David Lewis
- Conventionality: having to do with culture, etc.
- Lewis and Millikan share view: *linguistic meaning is conventional*
	- Supplying treats on Halloween
	- Speaking first in answering a phone call
	- Having a "Save" item under the "File" menu in a document editor

## Lewis on Convention
- convention is a regularity $R$ in the behavior of people in community $C$:
	1. everyone conforms to $R$
	2. everyone believes others conform to $R$
	3. these beliefs (2) give everyon decisive *reason* to conform to $R$
	4. everyone prefers general conformity over less-than-conformity
	5. some other regularity besides $R$ would satisfy (1-4)
	6. all of this is *common knowledge* in $C$

- ways a community is solving a kind of coordination problem: "What do we do when we greet each other???"
- basic phenomenon arises among rational agents *in virtue of* rationality

### Issues with Lewis Account
1. everyone conforms to $R$
	- issue: something being conventional is compatible with most people never doing that anyway (e.g. saying "hey" to greet people)
		- conventions needn't create anything like *mandates*
	- notion of conventionality doesn't seem to capture Grice's "having a tool in one's repertoire"
		- having a tool doesn't mean using it!
2. everyone *believes* others conform to $R$
	- if they aren't quasi-universal patterns (as in objection to 1), then you don't have to believe they are
3. these beliefs (2) give everyon decisive *reason* to conform to $R$
	- issue: some confirmity with conventional practice isn't reasoned at all, but unreflective mimicry (personal space, eye contact etc.)
	- also: there doesn't seem to be *decisive* reason to perform a convention as opposed to another one (I'm not deciding to say "hey" instead of something else)
4. everyone prefers general conformity over less-than-conformity
	- too strong: seems like there are many conventional practices that most people would prefer not continue
		- e.g. use of gender or racial slurs, challenging people to a fistfight or duel

### Lewis explaining the conventionality of language
Think of language as ways of encoding propositions
- mapping sentences --> propositions
- doesn't involve community / people
- question of conventionality: what is it for a particular language $L$ (or Chomsky "grammar") to be employed in community $C$?
	- Lewis: iff there are conventions in $C$ of being *truthful in $L$* and *trusting in $L$*
		- *truthful*: for sentence $S$ (on which function $F$ for language $L$ is defined), $A$ utters $S$ only when $A$ believes $L(S)$
		- *trusting*: for any sentence $S$, whenever $A$ hears $c\in C$ utter $S$, $A$ comes to believe $L(S)$

#### Worries for this account
- skipped: see ==slides==

## Millikan on Convention
- "Language Conventions Made Simple" (1998)
- **natural conventions**: patterns of behavior that are
	- *reproduced by weight of precedent*
		- new instances modeled on prior instances
		- "which prior instances model the behavior I'm undertaking now?" can help disambiguate, e.g., whether raising one's hand is used for voting or for raising a question (both are conventional)
		- handing down a skill is not proliferating a convention -- still need a kind of "arbitrariness" condition
			- skills are proliferated due to intrinsically superior capacities

### Counterpart reproduction
- learning to behave by complementing a matching behavior of the same or different form
	- handshakes, dances involving a leader and a follower, etc.
	- important w.r.t conventions of language -- pattern btwn asserter and understanding hearer is a conventional relationship w/ certain requirements

### Two jobs for conventions in language
#### Meaning conventions
- which conventional word 'bank' is being used when it's uttered? the one copied from the family of previous instances -- not a metaconvention or *rule*

#### Speech-act conventions
**assertion** and **acceptance**
- when $S$ tells $H$ something is the case in a *conventional* way, it's *conventional* for $H$ to believe it
	- a kind of handshake -- conventional way of behaving
	- this pattern would not be proliferated unless hearers routinely believed what they heard from speakers
- against *constitutive rules* for speech-act types (Austin, Searle, Strawson, others)
