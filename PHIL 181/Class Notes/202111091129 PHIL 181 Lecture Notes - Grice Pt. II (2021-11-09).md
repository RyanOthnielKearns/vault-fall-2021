Majority of ppl interested in foundations of linguistic communication / meaning --> consider themselves "broadly Gricean"
- meaning wells up out of use
- ought to be a way to characterize use of language
- w/ "Logic and Conversation," even more people think Grice is onto some general *phenomena*
	- both ordinary communication & what literal linguistic meaning *is* w.r.t. general philosophical methodology
- communication essentially is the intention to bring about certain effects in the audience via **communicative actions**
	- particular communicative action: *meaning* -- to mean, to express -- trying to get something across / trying to inform the hearer
	- distinctive: speaker's plan is that hearer have a kind of *reason* for the belief -- speaker is trying to rationally motivate the forming of the belief
		- namely: recognizing that speaker wants hearer to believe this thing
	- also commands, requests, promises, ... where ultimate upshot is not about forming a belief

## Worries
- the intention attributed to speakers is a pretty cognitively sophisticated one -- is Grice giving us too much credit / over-intellectualizing the speaker's aim in the communicative act? Seems like communication is not as sophisticated as this
	- Grice: w/ no explicit intention, attribute most plausible intention to the speaker given the context
		- Crimmins: seems to be confusion btwn the intention we have evidence for giving the speaker vs. the intention the speaker has *in the first place* (see [[202111041129 PHIL 181 Lecture Notes - Grice on (Speaker Occasion) Meaning (2021-11-04)#Worries|last section of last lecture]])
			- we often have intentions going beyond the conscious surface when we communicate
			- to describe exactly how world is given speaker's beliefs requires a *lot of complexity* -- but the speaker's communicative intention doesn't seem to present as complexly

### Alleged Counterexample to Sufficiency (Schiffer)
Imagine "planting evidence (a hankerchief at the crime scene), hoping to be observed, *but* hoping to look like you were trying not to be observed"
- actor intends the audience to take, as the reason to believe $p$, the actor's "belief-producing intention" of wanting the audience to believe $p$
- intending to counter that this intention is sufficient to count for the meaning of an utterance
- possible response: audience must be intended not *just* the belief-producing intention, but also *that they are intended to recognize* that belief-producing intention
	- but this iterates -- thus *all* intentions require the recognition that they're intended to be recognized (infinite regress?)
		- maybe the counterexamples at these higher levels work, but they're pretty hard to understand...
		- maybe get all of these infinitely many intentions if we consider *single* intention with *reflexive* (self-referential) content
			- "I intend for you to believe that $p$ based on your recognition of *this* intention"
	- argued that communicative acts have an overtness "above-board-ness" that does away with these sneaky acts like the hankerchief example
		- but what *is* this openness exactly?
		- this is a negative requirement -- a lack of sneaky intentions

### Alleged Counterexamples to Necessity
- maybe these conditions are already too much?
- you don't expect them to believe you (plea of innocence to a skeptical judge)
	- "I didn't do it!" -- did he *mean* something there? Seems like he meant he was innocent! But he had no hope of convincing anybody by saying it...
	- maybe you've just misplaced the effect? not the *belief* that $p$ but the *consideration* that $p$ (or that the *speaker thinks* that $p$)...
- you think they already believe it (exam answer)
	- "belief production doesn't seem to be in play"
- you don't have an audience (soliloquy)
	- "It's a lovely day"
	- Is there a virtual or imagined observer? Are you the audience? Maybe a future version of yourself is the audience, or whoever is going to hear the voicemail eventually...?

### Other worries about reductive strategy
- might hold onto "promising idea" that communication is only the rational idea / plan / intention of a speaker trying to impart belief unto audience
- but if going from "speakers meaning things" -> "speakers intending things about beliefs"... keep in mind circularity worries!
	- are belief-producing intentions metaphysically distinct enough from meaning & communication?
		- think about caveman stomping his feet to establish ownership of a carcass -- doesn't require a symbol system up and running to communicate this intention
		- but more complex: "I'll be on American Airlines flight 177 two weeks from Tuesday" -- how does one form an *intention* prior to having a sentence expressing the fact?
- are these *appropriate reductive grounds*? explaining the clear by the obscure
	- some philosophers don't even think there *are* beliefs and intentions -- relegated to the cognitive dustbin in the near future since they're a bit too obscure / hard to understand to be the right theory
		- e.g. **Donald Davidson**
	- should we reduce explanations of meaning -- which is simple(r?) to understand -- to intentions & belief?
		- maybe meaning is more metaphysically *primitive* than intention or belief and shouldn't be reduced in this way

## Remainder of reductive strategy
- patterns of speaker meaning *in general* can established conventionalized *symbols* for meaning things
	- symbol means something --> there is a standardized way for speakers meaning this thing
	- a strategy is standard for communicating something
	- what's a standard / conventional strategy for doing $x$? Good example: proper names
		- ==Evans== borrows this idea in "The Causal Theory of Reference" (see other notes for mention!!)
		- Expression $E$ means $M$ in community $C$:
			- depends on audience's knowledge of how $E$ has been used in $C$ in the past
			- success depends on familiarity of it as a historical means for accomplishing the goal
		- connection to communicative practices being conventional (see **David Lewis** in ==slides== (to link))

## Utterance literal meaning
- Grice's "what is said" -- closely related to [[Frege, "On Sense and Nominatum" - Reading Notes|Frege]] and [[2021-09-30 Slides for Russell's "On Denoting".pdf|Russell]]'s proposition expressed by speaker w/ their sentence
	- "what is said" <> *truth* (does the speaker literally speak truly?)
		- Grice never finds a detailed account of this that satisfies him
	- "I'm hungry" --> I'm literally saying that I'm hungry and trying to get across the meaning that I am hungry
		- Can express that you're hungry without saying that exactly, though -- can rub your stomach etc. -- **speaker-meaning** doesn't really require literally saying it
- pattern of use is determined by literal content, b/c people in general tend to say things they believe to be true
	- but get more specific: people exaggerate, lie, etc.
		- Grice does so w/ conceptual analysis: people *make as if to literally say something*, but don't speaker-mean what they literally say
			- instead they speaker-mean something else, via "get at," "hint at," "imply," etc.
			- subclass of speaker-meaning that is not speaker-meaning *by literally saying it*
			- why is Grice looking at this?
				- there are philosophical treatments that suffer from misunderstanding this concept

## Grice on Implicature
Primarily from [[H.P. Grice 1975, "Logic and Conversation".pdf|"Logic and Conversation"]] ([[202111090020 H.P. Grice 1975, "Logic and Conversation" - Reading Notes|reading notes]])

- we use "and," "or," "implies" in a way that seems to deviate from formal devices $\land$, $\lor$, $\rightarrow$
	- "If I lift my hand in the next three seconds, the podium will turn into a donkey" -- if I don't then lift my hand, this counts as true, but *ought the English sentence really be considered true*?
		- Grice: sure, but you do have a reason for saying this thing... hearer is licensed to think that speaker has some reason to say the thing!
			- speaker must not have knowledge about whether they're going to raise their hand or not! otherwise why would they put forward the conditional format of it? -- can understand the misleadingness of saying this, if the speaker were to intend to say this seriously -- what makes the sentence unacceptable or absurd
				- *there are constraints to do with the communicative effects of saying things (that go beyond what you immediately say)*

### Grice's motivations
discussed kinda in [[202111041129 PHIL 181 Lecture Notes - Grice on (Speaker Occasion) Meaning (2021-11-04)#Grice]]
- **foundations of semantics**
- **philosophical methodology**
- see ==slides== (link me)

### Basic idea
- nature of conversation is logical and cooperative --> this places constraints on how you must communicate to be cooperative

### Grice's tasks in "Logic and Conversation"
1. Explain **conventional implicatures**: implicatures *forced by expression-meaning*
	- conventions we all have for getting stuff across w/o outright saying it
	- or as a technical project in the foundations of language / communication -- here's something rational agents can participate in! (communication) --> has some explanatory role
	- contribute not just what is said, but also auxiliary implications / meanings
		- e.g. "and" vs. "but" -- "He's an Englishman (and/but) he's brave" -- same truth conditions! but mean different things about the relation of the two conjuncts (that is captured by the literal meanings of the words "and" and "but")
		- can determine stuff that you're *not* literally saying (e.g. that there's a contrast between being English and being brave, or there isn't)
2. Explain **conversational implicatures**
	- the paper is more about these "one-off" occurrences of implicature than the ones hammered in by convention (the "rest" of conversational implicatures)
	- arise in virtue of a certain class of **essential constraints** (non-arbitrary and non-conventional) on conversation
	- something about common background, common understanding, etc. allows these implicatures to get across between speaker and audience
		- a matter of rationality -- particular *norms* that govern conversation
		- it's rational to pursue shared aims in information exchanges
			- sort of analytic in what we mean by "conversation" for this -- constrain what we mean by cooperative rationality

### The Cooperative Principle
"Make your conversational contribution such as is required, at the stage at which it occurs, by the accepted purpose or direction of the talk exchange in which you are engaged" ([[H.P. Grice 1975, "Logic and Conversation".pdf|45]])
- some things make sense to say, and some things clearly don't!

### The Conversational Maxims
Sort of a Kantian thing here
- follow from the [[202111091129 PHIL 181 Lecture Notes - Grice Pt. II (2021-11-09)#The Cooperative Principle|CP]] given facts about what conversation *is*

1. **Quantity**
2. **Quality**
3. **Relation**
4. **Manner**

#### Failing to Fullfill the Maxims
- speaker understands they're in a predicament when they notice one of the maxims is being violated
- quietly *violate* (e.g. lying)
- *opt out* - refuse to be cooperative
	- it can be *rational* to do this... does this conflict with the rational grounding of [[202111091129 PHIL 181 Lecture Notes - Grice Pt. II (2021-11-09)#The Cooperative Principle|CP]] itself?
- fulfilling only one of two clashing maxims
	- e.g. quality vs quantity -- wanting to provide enough information vs. wanting to only give information that the speaker has reason to believe
	- "Which country is John in today?" --> "Norway or Portugal."
- *flout*: fail to fulfill the maxim at the level of what's literally said
	- e.g. Grice's account of irony

### Grice's explanation of conversational implicature
- epistemology of implicature
	- "There must be something being implicated here" --> how does the hearer determine what specifically?
		- Not a matter of computationally / compositionally analyzing literally what is said
- someone who says $p$ and implicates $q$ has *conversationally* implicated $q$ iff:
	1. he is obeying CP
	2. the supposition *that the speaker thinks that $q$* is required to render presumption consistent with him *having made as if to say* that $p$
	3. "The only way that could make sense is if the speaker intends me to conclude that they conclude that $q$"
	- *Speaker intention constitutive of implicature*

next time... metaphor & irony, interesting complexities
