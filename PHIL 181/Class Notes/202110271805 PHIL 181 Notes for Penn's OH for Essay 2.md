I think I'm the most interested in Putnam's "Twin Earth" arguments for the meaning <> psychological state distinction in his paper "Meaning and Reference," but I'd ideally like to hone my prompt into something more specific than "explain and assess." For one thing, I don't love Putnam's example in his systematically swapping out a natural kind like water for a thought experiment that's intended to be intuitive. I think that part of Putnam's insistence that "water was H2O in 1750 as well as 1950" has to hinge on the compositional properties of water that so integrate it with other molecular structures. First, this Twin Earth experiment is just plainly unintuitive for me for this reason, since the molecular structure of water is *relevant* for its interactions with other substances that would be noticeable to a nonexpert observer -- think solubility as an example.

1. Twin Earth is supposed to be "exactly" like Earth
2. The extension of the term "water" was H2O (or XYZ on Twin Earth) in 1750 as well as in 1950
3. Oscar_1 and Oscar_2 do not have any diverging beliefs about "water"
4. Oscar_1 and Oscar_2 were in the same psychological state whenver they engaged with the meaning of the term "water"
5. *Yet* Oscar_1 and Oscar_2 understand the term "water" differently

I just don't see how such a thought experiment could be intuitive. It forces me to abandon one of my intuitions about natural kinds, namely that they functionally integrate. Water having the properties it does has to do with hydrogen and oxygen having the properties they do -- a canonical example would be solubility. "Water" is enmeshed within a web of related concepts having to do with its relational structure; if you pull on it in a counterfactual scenario, you will inevitably drag other (observable) things with you, and I think this holds for any interesting example of a natural kind term identified with an empirical necessary identity statement.

Something that seems necessary for the example is the fact that water_E and water_TE are *in principle* distinguishable, say by the state of molecular chemistry in 1950. This distinguishability in principle is what makes the meanings of "water" different between Earth and Twin Earth in 1750. Yet this "distinction in principle" wasn't just a theoretical breakthrough in 1950; it also leads to an expanded set of predictions about water's behavior on the actual Earth, for example electrolysis.

I think the entire scope of my argument could be aimed at this unintuitiveness of Putnam's first example.

# Notes from Penn meeting
- 3 or 4 parts to prompt 10
	- explication to be 60%
		- first explicate the view the argument is going against -- quick summary of received view that argument going against
		- then what the argument is
		- then what kind of picture about language that leaves us with
	- assessment to be 40%
		- picture that this leaves us with -- some examples from our use of language that don't really jive with the picture we're given
		- give objection and then reply to it -- objection better not be a strawman objection
- if arguing that thought experiment is not intuitive -- how does this diverge from the way we actually use language? why is this so different from the way we use it / making some assumption against what's intuitive? --> makes the conclusion irrelevant
	- describing, at the root, the "rigid designation" counterpart theory debate
	- Putnam's "natural kinds" very similar to Kripke's account of names -- "rigid designators"
	- David Lewis' counterpart theory "changes are going to 'ripple out'"
- hidden behind Putnam's view of natural kinds is an essentialism similar to Kripke's about proper names
	- water is h2o in every possible world -- an essential feature of water that it's composed of h2o

- thought experiment makes some assumptions that aren't really true about our use of language to refer / etc.
	- why is it odd in such a way that it shouldn't be seen as applying to our institution of language
	- ==odd in terms of our institution of language or odd in terms of our intuitive theory of the world?== --> specifically the language / institution of natural kind terms and how they operate
- what about that word "understood" on p. 702? depends upon your understanding of "understanding"
- water is XYZ -- but why do we think that this must be the meaning of "water" on Twin Earth?
- externalist view of language seems unintuitive abstractly, but with concrete examples it seems to make sense -- trying to get pictures of certain phenomena
