[[H.P. Grice 1957, "Meaning".pdf|Grice 1957, "Meaning"]]
___
- distinguishing between *natural* and *nonnatural* senses of meaning
	- natural sense of meaning
		- "Those spots mean (meant) measles."
		- "The recent budget means that we shall have a hard year.'"
		- also agent $A$ *meant to do* $x$
		- "$x$ meant that $p$" entails $p$
	- nonnatural sense (means$_{NN}$)
		- "Those three rings on the bell (of the bus) mean that the 'bus is full.'"
		- in this sense *x means that p* and *x meant that p* do not entail *p*
	- this distinction is related to the one between *natural* and *conventional signs*, but more generic

# What is meaning$_{NN}$?
- according to Grice, *not* a causal notion, i.e. that $x$ produces a tendency / "process of conditioning attending to the sign in communication" (379)
	- this is C. L. Stevenson's take
	- kind of circular... "$x$ has meaning$_{NN}$ if it's used in communication"
	- also restricts us to just talking about the "standard meaning" of a sign -- to Grice, this leaves stuff out
	- causal theory ignores the fact that the meaning of a sign = what users of it *do mean* on *particular occasions* of use
- Grice's tack: try to explain particular occasions of this phenomen in a way that helps generalize to "meaning$_{NN}$" in a more timeless way
	- first take: it's about inducing a belief in some "audience" (p. 381)
		- have to at least add that the utterer intended the audience to *recognize* the intention
		- trying to find the difference between "deliberately and openly letting someone know / getting them to think" and "telling them"
			- are you trying to get me to believe something, or not?
	- $A$ must intend to induce a belief to an audience (with $x$), and also intend this intention be recognized by the audience (as a part of inducing the belief or "by means of") (for $x$ to mean$_{NN}$ something)
- so far this is only *informative* cases, not *imperative* ones
