- how to conceive of difference between $\land$ and "and", $\exists$ and "exists," etc?
	1. **formalists**: formal devices have a "decisive advantage" and can be combined to form other patterns of (dubious, maybe, but acceptable) inferences
		- divergences in natural meanings from formal ones, e.g. divergences in meaning of "and" vs $\land$, are imperfections of natural language! --> not fully intelligible or "metaphysically loaded"
	2. **informalists**: contend that assumptions made by formalists are overbearing
		- e.g., that languaged should be measured by ability to serve scientific inquiry
		- there are natural language "logical" inferences that are not systematic but still valid
- **main thesis**: the distinction between natural and formal logical devices is mistaken
	- we need to think about conversational conditions to see why

- "say" vs. "implicate"
	- "say" $\approx$ the conventional meaning of the sentence
	- certain subclass of conversational implicatures: **conversational implicatures**

# Conversational Implicatures
**Cooperative Principle**: conversations are guided by an accepted purpose or direction by the participants engaged
- make your contributions suitable for such purpose / direction
- conversational implicatures are not part of the *meaning* of the expressions they're attached to ([[H.P. Grice 1975, "Logic and Conversation".pdf|58]])

4 principles which together adhere to the cooperative principle (discussed in [[202111032337 "Paul Grice" SEP Entry Notes]])
- these are aimed at explicating the particular purposes that talk is adapted to serve (at the expense of other probably obeyed maxims like "politeness"...)
- well-recognized empirical fact that people *do* behave in these ways

## Quantity
Contributions are:
1. As informative as required
2. Not more informative than required
## Quality
Seemingly the most important!
- Try to make your contribution one that's true
- Do not say what you believe to be false, or lack sufficient evidence for.
## Relation
"Be relevant"
## Manner
- About *how* what is said is said
- "Be perspicuous"
	- Avoid obscurity / ambiguity
	- Be brief / orderly

# Talk exchanges -> general cooperative transactions
- participants share common immediate aim
- contributions of participants are mutually dependent
- the transaction should continue until both parties agree to terminate

# Connecting Conversational Implicature <> Conversational Maxims
A man saying $p$ has implicated $q$ iff:
1. he is observing conversational maxims
	- or *flouting* them with some intention to be captured by the audience as part of the implication
2. the supposition that 'he thinks $q$' is required in order to make saying $p$ consistent with following the CP and the maxims (==not sure I understand this perfectly on the first pass...==)
3. he expects the listener to come to the same conclusion that 2. is required
