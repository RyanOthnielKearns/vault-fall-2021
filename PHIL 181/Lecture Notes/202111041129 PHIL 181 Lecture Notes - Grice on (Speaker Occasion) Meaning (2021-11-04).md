# Finishing up Putnam
- real analogy w/ Kripke -- individual, compentent language users have "grasp" of term
	- can point at subject matter they're talking about
	- *without* individuating understanding or grasp of "what it is"
	- further empirical claims that names in english work this way (/ species kinds, natural kinds, etc.)
		- empirical question -- deserves to be much more controvertial (Crimmins)
- term latching on natural kind who's actual essence is not grasped by speakers of the language
	- **normative evaluative talk**? (good, right, just, etc) --> what distinguishes "right" actions might not be something that we tacitly grasp, in similar way to natural kinds (so say students of Putnam)
		- maybe the *right-making features of actions* might be some (unseen) natural features that they share
			- we might see symptoms -- but *what it is* to be right might be something we have to discover through inquiry
	- what other terms might work in this way? Putnam has put this into our toolkit
- also: what's the big deal w/ this protoscientific use of language (for science)?
	- why have scientific terms that work the Putnam-way, rather than the Lockean-way?
	- scientific take: allows us to use a term for a kind w/o making pretheoretic claim about *what it is*
		- *allows theory change w/ constant linguistic subject matter*
		- otherwise: if we change our theory of, say, stars from holes in a sphere to balls of gas -- *in what sense is there progress*?
			- Kuhn: not all that clear! two different theorists mean completely different thing with "star" -- dealing with different subject matter!
			- Putnam's story defends idea that there *is* constancy of subject matter across radical theory changes in science

# Movements in history of Phil. Language: Empiricists & Positivists; Use Theorists
- Carnap and Quine -- logicians with philosophical interests!
	- leveraging improvements in formal systems to account for structure & worldly content of language
- "countercurrent" in philosophy of language
	- Wittgenstein: one of the earlier advocates of logical positivism
		- argued that sentential meaning has to be matter of boolean combinations of atomic sentences
		- logical analysis of "scientifically kosher" language
		- Wittgenstein himself realized he was mistaken: language is a messy communicative thing -- no clean "jobs" for sentences in languages...
			- look instead at how language serves us in various social environments
			- give up this idea that there's some logical "essence" in language
- also going on at Oxford
	- debate btwn "formalists" and "use theorists" ("ordinary language philosophers" in Oxford tradition)
		- use theorists: use practices are the real target here -- logical formulations should take back seat
			- Wittgenstein, but also J.L. Austin, H.P. Grice
				- Austin: makes distinction btwn "things a speaker does" (*speech acts* -- one squwack is multiple deeds)
					- said various words, *meant* what those words mean, made an assertion, implied that someone should act based off assertion, etc.
					- Austin: elaborate taxonomy of these things -- some of these are distinctly linguistic, some aren't

## Grice
- Grice: can mesh what's going on with formalist contruction and use theory w/ an account of meaning
	- will discussion: two of his papers in the foundational literature of semantics / pragmatics
- interested in notion of "saying"
	- one thing you can do w/ sentence: use it *seriously*
		- Russell: what you express w/ the sentence is a proposition
		- related, Carnap: there is a literal content of the sentence -- what it's *intended to do*
		- ofc: you can use a sentence ironically, be acting on a stage, etc...
			- but this *literal claim* (something true or false depending on the world / accessible evidence) is *paradigmatic* here
		- take seriously that there is something that is the literal content of sentences
			- --> then **what is literal content?** how is it going on in linguistics? how do we figure out what content of a sentence / squwack is?
			- Grice was worried about way Oxford colleagues were addressing this question
				- upshot of [[Logic and Conversation]]: whether speaker is going to say / assert a sentence ( #TODO ==cite this==)
					1. whether they think sentence is true; but also
					2. how they think the audience with *receive* how they've uttered the sentence
						- might include idiosyncratic reasons in a particular context
- patterns of usage aren't a good guide to literal meaning
	- but: what else is there than patterns of usage to *ground* meaning?
	- Grice insists that linguistic meaning is just standardized usage
		- goal as a theorist -- get clearer about these lingusitic concepts of use --> meaning, to make headway on this claim
		- for both phil. language and also methodological reasons in philosophy
	- not like language is handed down to us by gods...

# Grice 1597, "Meaning"
[[H.P. Grice 1957, "Meaning".pdf|paper]]
- task: speaker occasion meaning is an important aspect of meaning
	- happens a lot
	- to understand more sophisticated concepts of meaning (symbols/signs) -- how does it well up from cases where this context is applicable (speakers *meaning things* on particular occasions)
	- two targets in this paper
		1. explain something central to communicative action
			- speaker occasion meaning crucial to understand this particular kind of action
		2. "ground level" of systematic story of how other aspects of meaning arise
			- constitution of linguistic meaning
			- what is it that constitutes these lingusitic meaning facts? --> has something to do w/ organisms communicating w/ each other

## Upshot
- communicative action is rational / intentional behavior
	- have their own distinctive aims
	- produce cognitive effects in receptive audience
		- not reflexively happening, but *through the audience's rational capacities* as well
			- this is the goal the speaker has w/ their communicative display
- **linguistic meaning** grounded in standardized routines for communicative action
	- standardization happens as speakers come to rely on certain intended effects
		- can standardize on individual words -- makes it easier to have cognitive acts occur
- Grice: doesn't have to invent a technical concept for *meaning* -- ordinary language has been a mechanism for conceptual analysis / development for millenia!
	- might be that these concepts are on the right track for a serious account of what we're talking about!
	- "here's an ordinary concept that looks like it might serve our theoretical purposes"

## Conceptual Analysis
What's the project?
- there are some cognitive linguistic tools that we have (e.g. the thing "meaning" that we have word for)
- not that our competence *underdetermines* the definition -- we "get" the definition of (say, *meaning*) -- we just have trouble articulating it
	- there is something to analyze; e.g., the certain concept -- allows us to assess the accuracy of proposed definitions
		- have to point at that certain concept w/o proposing a definition for it, and only then propose a definition
- suggest an analysis, then try to imagine cases to test the proposed definition
	- looking for counterexamples:
		1. evaluate *necessity* by trying to find actual/possible cases where concept applies but definition does not
		2. evaluate *sufficiency*... (==see slides==)
	- lots of philosophers think that *knowledge* is an evaluative cognitive concept -- everyday language users *know* what is meant by "to know" & can assess proposed definitions

### Assessing Grice's account
- as conceptual analysis: does it identify / explicate an ordinary concept?
	- give necessary / sufficient conditions that seem to get it right?
- as foundational philosophy of language: aside from identifying ordinary concept, does it develop a technical concept w/ promise to help us understand communication / lingustic meaning?

## Gricean analysis
### 1. Pointing at a target
- we use "mean" to mean something like "indicate" or "entail"
	- "These tree rings mean the tree is 100 years old"
	- also as a synonym for "intend"
		- "I meant to return the book to the library"
- sometimes we are talking about "meaning" in a broadly communicative / lingustic sense
	- *non-natural* or *artifactual* use of meaning
	- the kinds of meaning that are *invested* in behavior by forces of the intellect
		- "meaning" of the bus driver ringing the bell isn't a natural connection, but rather bus driver invests some sort of intentional attitude --> human contrivance invests meaning in behavior / signs...
- **speaker occasion meaning**: agent $A$ meant something in performing action $U$
	- what a particular agent meant on particular occasion in/by doing particular action
	- nothing about that type of behavior *generally* means!
- **expression timeless meaning**: the expression $E$ means something in community $C$
	- a matter of what cognitive tools are up and running in a community (group of agents)
	- w/ a type of signal they'd like to display
- **utterance literal meaning**: $A$'s utterance $U$ literally meant something
	- a kind of intersection of the two above -- both an occasional utterance, but crucially relying on standardized meaning of $U$

#### Attempt #1
$A$ meant something or other by utterance $U$ iff:
- $A$ intended $U$ to cause an audience to believe something

##### Counterexamples
- to sufficiency: (where does definition apply where concept does not?)
	- e.g. secretly planting evidence to implicate someone in a crime
	- there's something to meaning that's not just about getting a belief across
- Grice: what's missing? the point that the audience is to *know* that the speaker is intending to get some belief across (below:)

#### Attempt #2
$A$ meant something or other by utterance $U$ iff:
- $A$ intended $U$ to cause an audience to believe something, and to recognize that they are so intended

##### Counterexamples
- does handle the hankerchief example! (from #1)
- counterexamples to sufficiency:
	- "merely showing"
		- Herod presents Salome with John the Baptist's head
			- In order to convince her that John the Baptist has been killed -- and he's intending that she realizes his goal
			- open fact that he's trying to produce a belief -- but has nothing to do with his say-so / assurance that this is the case
			- Salome's reasons for concluding that John the Baptist is dead -- not taking into account Herod's believability w.r.t testimony / his "say-so" and his well-intentions
			- "it's not that I think he's well-informed on the matter! it's like, here is John the Baptist's severed head... people with severed heads are dead... so, you know, John the Baptist is dead"

#### Final Proposal
$A$ meant something or other by utterance $U$ iff:
- $A$ intended $U$ to cause an audience to believe something by reason of the recognition that they were so-intended to believe
- this recognition has to be part of what the audience relies on in deciding if the given proposition is true
	- "I think that his plan in saying that / signaling that was to get me to believe that \[the bus is full\]"
		- but meaning can *misfire*: audience is allowed to fail in understanding / relying on the recognition (called "failure of uptake")
	- to Grice: that is the key thing about meaning
		- attempt to get something across *on your say-so* -- listener is supposed to come to believe the utterance by recognizing that they were intended to produce the belief
			- e.g. when someone tells you "My name is Fred."
- known as a **Gricean (reflexive) intention**
	- argued to be relevant to many philosophically interesting interpersonal phenomena

##### On this account...
- *meaning* is a species of *intending*
	- *meaning* something is not a success notion
- notions of intending, believing, judging for a reason essential components of the *explans*

##### Worries
"perlocutionary" effect
- if I try to motivate you to vote for Brown by telling you that he once ran a marathon, does this analysis entail that I meant "you should vote for Brown?"
	- Grice: it's my plan that you will believe that you should vote for him *because you are impressed by marathoners* -- not intending that you should trust me on voting for Brown
- does this amount to "peopling all our talking life with armies of psychological occurrences"?
	- pretty sophisticated -- should we attribute this to little children?
	- Grice: no -- don't always have conscious explicit plans
	- "seems like a confusion of epistemology w/ the philosophy of intention" - Crimmins
		- the *real* answer to what they intended is up to how their behavior would be interpreted given what's observable - Grice
			- but: people *really* have sophisticated intentions that they don't have articulated on the surface of their thought
				- this is a fact of the matter -- how you *really* intended things go (not up to interpretation) in an automatic, routinized way
		- problematically abandoning his *realism about intentions* -- undercuts reasons to be optimistic about the conceptual analysis / utility of speaker occurences for explaining communication
