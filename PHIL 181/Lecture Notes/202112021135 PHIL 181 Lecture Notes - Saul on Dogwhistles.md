# Saul on Dogwhistles
- how it entered public consciousness: Michael De Cock's ad campaign, Ronald Reagan's political campaigns ("race baiting")
	- a lot of unpalletable racial opinions "unsayable" in the way they "used to be" (pre civil rights movement, e.g.)
	- to make sense that a candidate is "on the side of" racial attitudes, resentment, etc. -- w/ "*plausible deniability*" (come back to this)

## Taxonomy
1. Intentional vs. Unintentional
	- sometimes the one concocting the effect intends it to be interpreted in the dogwhistle way, sometimes not
2. Covert vs. Overt
	- whether the recipient is intended to recognize the intended content (overt) or not

## Limitations?
- not limited to racial issues, or the right on the american political spectrum
- also not limited to negative things! think adult jokes inside Disney films as dogwhistles
	- just signaling attitudes w/o going out and saying it

## Out-of-Toolkit Proposal
- depart from using rationalistic, communicative tools inherited from Grice, Lewis, Stalnaker, Millikan, etc.
	- look to empirical/social psychology
	- dogwhistles achieve effects using subconscious mechanisms that are poorly modeled here
- classify instead as **perlocutionary**: *caused by* the use of language, *not* costituted from the materials of linguistic communication (content, speaker-meaning, etc.)
	- e.g. *getting you to shut the door* by saying "it's cold in here"
