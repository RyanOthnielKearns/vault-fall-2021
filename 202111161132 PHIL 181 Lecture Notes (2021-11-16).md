- getting at from [[202111111132 PHIL 181 Lecture Notes - Conversational Implicature and Conventionality of Language (2021-11-11)|last time]]: **conventionality**
	- language is a "creature of culture" -- sense in which it's contingent and arbitrary how linguistic practice is molded for particular languages
	- is this conventionality special to language?
		- Lewis / Millikan: this conventionality as a piece of other conventions as well
			- Millikan: Lewis's account is objectionable in detail -- overintellectualizes the "game-theoretic" context for meaning -- out of line with our commonalities w/ *simpler organisms*
				- we're creatures who can be trained up to behave in ways that are modeled off of ways we've seen
				- *language doesn't separate us so drastically from other animals*, and we're capable of it in our *least reflective moments*
	- foundations of meaning in language -- very important and still very open!

# Millikan's conventions
- conventions: essentially *historical*
	- momentum in a pattern of behavior created by historical existence of the pattern
- tempted to explain conventions as "tacit agreements" -- as though we all agree to greet each other by shaking right hands, e.g.
	- conventions can be instituted by explicit agreement (don't need history!)
		- doesn't take familiarity w/ a pattern of behavior to get these conventions off the ground
		- can Millikan accomodate this? is the historical momentum actually contingent?
- big advance over Lewis': Lewis talks as if conventions are things *everyone* does *all the time*
	- conventions more like "tools in our toolkit" -- we can take them out when we want to
		- is the causal "modeling" conception of participation too thin to explain Millikan's "opting in" phenomena?
		- "which are the historical raisings of hands, such that had they gone slightly differently, this current raising of hands would go slightly differently?"
			- this current instance is then *modeled* off of these historical instances
			- e.g., historical instances of hand raising for greeting vs. voting purposes
				- but: we can definitely just imitate performances of a different convention than the one we intend to participate in

# Kripkenstein's Skeptical Problem
- Kripke on Wittgenstein's *Philosophical Investigations*
- generated huge literature on this particular problem Kripke reports to find
	- *Kripke* is not authoring the problem -- saying "you can read the *Investigations* as claiming that there is this certain insoluble skeptical problem"
		- Thus the "author" of the skeptical problem = Kripkenstein

## The Target
- **grasping a rule**: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, ... 8!
	- once you know "every number is the sum of the previous two," you can *go on* -- what you know "finishes" this infinite list in a sense
	- *what you grasp* determines *how this rule applies* forever
		- meaning of the word "plus" has this character
		- **instant grasp**: you seemingly understand the rule *now*
		- **generality**: the rule you grasp *now* has implications for vastly variable cases that have not yet arisen
			- "infinitary consequence"
		- **justification**: your grasp of the rule *justifies* your efforts in following it correctly
	- **question**: how can we do this sort of rule grasping?
		- Kripkenstein: nothing (about me) can satisfy this achievement

## The Model: Hume on Induction
- Kripke employs Hume as an example of philosophical skepticism that Wittgenstein plays off of
	- enumerative induction: generalizing causality from some sufficient number of finite cases (when I stick my hand in the fire, it hurts! --> few times doing this, and it dawns on me that this might be a *regularity*)
		- was the inductive evidence *relevant* and *positive* for inferring the *regularity*? Hume: no, not deductively valid at all
			- definitely logically possible for your hand to be fine the $n+1$'th time you stick it in the fire!
			- what else might there be to justify taking the evidence as relevant to your generalized conclusion?
				- this is the **skeptical problem**
				- Hume can't come up with anything
	- Hume's tack: eliminating possible **straight answers** (that refute the skeptical basis itself)
		- instinctive trust that the future will be like the past *can't be circularly justified* (e.g., via the justification that *in the past*, the future was like the past)
			- this refutes the "probabilistic" straight answer
		- another candidate: "pragmatic" straight answer ("people who trust that the future will be like the past *tend to do better* in life")
		- another: "paradigm of rationality" argument: a paradigmatically rational way of behaving / believing involves trusting that the future will be like the past
			- "inductive rationality" as a species of rationality
			- but (Hume): why should I govern my belief by this word "rationality" -- for me as a reasoner, *how confident should I be* that my hand will hurt when I put it in the flame? "Rationality" doesn't tell me anything about how to justify my levels of confidence
	- Hume's **skeptical "solution"**: sort of "giving up" (acquiescence)
		- "Don't think I'm missing anything here... There is maybe just *no good reason* to justify inductive reasoning"
		- Rationally speaking, I should just be agnostic about cases in the rest of the universe I can only access via inductive reasoning
		- so: how can we accomodate this acquiescence?
			- we just sort of recognize that humans are hardwired inductive reasoners! that's what human reasoning *is*
				- Darwinist: populations of humans that don't follow inductive reasoning haven't survived
				- We've evolved in a world where the future has been like the past -- we have no deductive evidence for this -- but so long as the world continues to be this way we should be fine! but it could not be in the future...

### Running Example
I say "$5 + 2 = 7$" at time $t$
- I *meant* addition by "$+$"
- Unless I change my meaning, my grasp of the arithmetical function "addition" and my labeling it "$+$", determined which "$+$"-sentences were going to be true: the ones that accord with the rule I grasped

Now, at later time $t_1$, I say "$68+57=125$"
- *what past fact about me (at $t$) explains why this accords with what I meant by "$+$" then?*
	- e.g., as opposed to giving the answer $5$ in place of $125$ (which would be the result if I in fact meant the "quaddition" function as explained in [[Kripke Exerpts from Wittgenstein on Rules and Private Language.pdf|the paper]]?)
	- what "hooked me up" with the addition function at time $t$, when I used "$+$"

#### Some Straight Answers
Facts that might constitute my meaning the addition function:
1. A brute fact that's inexplicable in terms of others
	- no explanation of it except that it's a "brute plank" building up nature
	- Kripkenstein: this doesn't look like the kind of fact that's a good candidate for "brute fact of nature"
		- relationship between the "$+$" babble and this abstract arithmetical function -- is this really a brute fact of nature?
2. A conscious state with a distinctive qualitative character
	- an *aspect of my consciousness* is what explains why I meant addition when I said "$+$"
		- e.g., it's in virtue of some phenomenological character
	- Kripkenstein: why should my having various *feelings* settle my employment of the $+$ sign?
		- maybe my conscious experience varies a lot when I'm pondering addition problems -- might not have a consistent experience to point to
			- even so: why would this be *relevant* to my meaning? how would it *constitute* that?
3. An explicit definition or rule-statement (or other linguistic item)
	- maybe I had "instructions" in my head for how to employ the function
	- Kripkenstein's response: *regress*
		- a definition of '$+$' can only determine how '$+$' is used if the definition *means* something -- how does this definition get *it's* meaning?
			- do we need other definitions for this definition to have meaning?
		- a finite axiomatization, in contrast, *would* solve this for us!
4. Dispositions, e.g. to endorse '$+$' statments that are in agreement with the addition function
	- at time $t$, I have language-use dispositions, such that I would not have accepted "$57+68 = 5$" *at that time*
	- dispositions are somehow finitely based... and if you feed me various addition problems, *something*'s going to happen!
	- Kripkenstein: get clear about what infinity means here!
		- most addition problems are ones that I have no coginitive means of accepting!
		- don't have dispositions of any kind in accordance w/ most addition problems
		- also, when you get to really large numbers: my dispositions are *finite* and *faulty*
	- also: my dispositions are not *normative*, so how can they ground *norms* for usage?

#### Twists on the Disposition / Definition Ideas
- maybe I'm not applying a function but rather an *algorithm* (e.g. adding numbers via memory for small $n$, then w/ the grade-school method)
- maybe I have dispositions s.t. the *simplest* function approximitely fitting the despisitions *is* addition
	- addition is the nearest "fit" to all of the data points about how I'm disposed to give answers
		- thus mistakes are a kind of "noise" in this fit

## The Skeptical Conclusion
*No fact about me* at $t$ constitutes my having meant addition by "$+$," and so there is no fact of the matter about what I meant by "$+$"
- In general, there are no meaning facts at all. In fact, the world is completely meaningless
- ... what consolation prize to we get? that's analagous to Hume's "we're hardwired to do it" accomodation

### A Worry about the Skeptical Argument
1. it's an argument by *elimination*
	- even if none of Kripkenstein's possibilities are correct as he argues, maybe we're just not being insightful and creative enough in discovering "grounding facts" for meaning!
	- The "but you didn't cover my theory!" possibility will keep coming up...
2. Maybe *meaning addition* is actually grounded by some psychological, social, etc. facts, but the explanation of that grounding is beyond us
	- I'm confident that I *mean* the word "plus," so there's got to be some grounding somewhere, even if I don't know what it is
	- like the philosopher's committment that *mental* facts are grounded by *neurological* facts, but no one is confident in a worked-out explanation
3. An "in principle worry" -- *normativity* of meaning
	- Kripke seems to argue that meaning facts have *normative entailments*
		- what does this mean?
		- maybe norms of correctness or norms of truth
	- connection between meaning and these norms about "what to do" -- seems looser than Kripke lets on

- *does not mean* that the meaning of "$+$" is in being in accordance w/ the community's use of "$+$"
