- **DNS**: domain name server; used to resolve `google.com` -> some IP addr
- **socket**: bidirectional pipe
	- `createServerSocket(port)`: server-side function
		- returns file descriptor (where the client sends connect requests)
		- binds the port of all IP addresses associated w/ server
		- the file descriptor returned is passed to `accept`
			- goes into queue of pending clients, pops it off, and deals w/ the client
			- can set queue to any length you want (`int` passed into `listen` fxn)
- on client side: `createClientSocket(server/port (IP addr), port)`
	- creates file descriptor and sends file descriptor to server, so that client and server can communicate via a socket
