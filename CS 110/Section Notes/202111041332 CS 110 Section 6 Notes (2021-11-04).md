- problem 1
	- mutex
	- cv
- problem 2
	- mutex
	- semaphore
	- limiting / running threads

# Threadpool
- limits # of threads
	- recycles threads for you
- `schedule`
- `wait`
	- called after you've scheduled everything
	- blocks until everything you've scheduled is completed
- word of caution
	- when creating private vars in threadpools -- initialize integers and booleans to zero / true etc.
		- not automatically done so by compiler!

# `compileAll` implementation
```
static void compileAll(vector<source>& sources) {
	vector<thread> threads(size);
	semaphore permits(8);
	vector<cva> cvas(sources.size);
	for (source s : sources) {
		threads[i] = thread(compileThread, ref(cvas),
							ref(permits), ref(i), ref(sources));
	}
	for (thread& t : threads) {
		t.join();
	}
}
```
- only grab permit when ready to compile

```
compileThread() {
	cvas[*i].wait(source.lock, [this]{ return compiled; });
	permits.wait();
	compile(source.name);
}
```
- condition variables are not the way to go... use a semaphore, which knows the number of sources a given source is waiting on to compile!
	- also store this semaphore within the struct! so you can access it when you loop over all sources
